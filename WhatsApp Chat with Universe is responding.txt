5/29/20, 8:10 AM - +91 88051 41117: I received some really wonderful feedbacks yesterday from an age-group of 20 to 55!! Taking the liberty that these groups offer me, I am sharing a video which *might* resonate with everyone. 

People over here have been in a variety of relations, right from being a child to having a grandchild!! The 10 year old to the 70 year old might find something to take from this! 

Read today’s post in-line with yesterday’s post! ✌️
💚 *Love is ever-lasting forgiveness!* 💚

So that means some things hurt... What about this hurt??Is it possible to be in a relationship where no one hurts each other? 

Let's recollect as a kid! How many times have you put up a long face and sat away when some action of parents leave us angry/sad/dissatisfied!

You can relate this video to any phase of your life... Be it as a child, sibling, friend, couple, parent, grandparent! 😇😇

6/4/20, 7:59 AM - +91 88051 41117: A group of 50 people attended a seminar. Suddenly the speaker stopped and started giving each person a Balloon. Each one was asked to write his/her name on it using a marker.

Then all the Balloons were collected and put in another room. Now these Delegates were let into that room and asked to find the balloon which had their respective names written on within 5 minutes. Everyone was frantically searching for their names, pushing and colliding with each other, and there was utter Chaos. At the end of 5 minutes, No One could find their own Balloons.

Now each one was asked to Randomly Collect a Balloon and Give It to the Person whose Name was written on it. Within minutes, Everyone had their own Balloons. The Speaker began:

This is exactly what is happening, in our lives. *Everyone is frantically looking for happiness, all over the place, not knowing where it is.* Our Happiness Lies in the Happiness of Other People. Help them Find their Happiness and You will Get your Own Happiness too. And this is the Purpose of Human Life... *Learn to Put a Smile on Someone's Face, and You will also Smile in due course.​*

MORAL: *For it is in giving that we receive*

Affirm and act on "Today I Radiate Love & Positive Energy ✨✨ I am the reason for happiness in the lives connected with me 💙"

Did you check yesterday's video?? If not, please spare 2.43 minutes to see it first!! This video is to set the tone for the week!!
Now that you have experienced how much of positive thinking is needed, let's break it down as to how to achieve it. 🎯🎯🎯

In the next three days I will be posting certain affirmations on the three areas to which most of us would relate - health🧘🏼‍♀️ relationship❤️ finances 💎💰

You can call it Law of attraction, affirmations or the very famous dialogue of SRK - *Kehte hain agar kisi cheez ko dil se chaaho to puri kayanat usey tumse milane ki koshish main lag jaati hai* 🦋🦋🦋

I will be giving some blanket affirmations for the above three areas. (In case anyone wants for a specific subject feel free to connect)

*What do you have to do?* 🎯
For the next 21 days spare 5 minutes to read or write this affirmations in true spirit! You can record in your own voice and leave it to play in the background or paste it on your mirror and look at it when you brush! (You can find your own way!)

*Why 21 days?*
It takes 21 days to form a neuropath. A passing thought, per se, does not impact us so much but repeatedly thinking the same thoughts create feelings in us and these feelings are then manifested💭💭

So, we will divide the next three days into parts. Firstly, we will release the old neuropath and then create new neuropaths! 

*Your personal miracles are on the way🦋*

Many people have poor thoughts when it comes to their own capabilities. When you think low for your own self, that's the vibration you send in the universe. For many a 7 digit or 8,9,10 digit income seems far away. 

We need to first break the image of money we have for ourself.

*Always remember, there is Abundance!!* The question is -
Are you willing to tap that abundance???

Last entire week I had focused on Affirmations and Law of Attraction! Generally if 100 people are informed, only 1 or 2 do this, but I am amazed by the response I have got! *Take a moment to appreciate yourself 😉👏🏻*

🔯🔯This week I will be posting on the concept *"Right"*. Stay tuned so that you can connect the dots backwards! 🔯🔯

Sharing a very famous quote for you to introspect on!

A bird can fly only with the help of two wings. 🦢🦢🕊️🕊️

*One wing is karma (action) and the other wing is knowledge*. 

If there is only one wing, then the other is useless. With the help of one, bird cannot fly. ( –Devarata to King Shantanu in Mahabharata)

*Look within and ask -*
Do I act without knowledge or Do I have knowledge that is not acted upon?

It's a long one, but worth your time! Happy reading! 

*WHAT KIND OF PERSON ARE YOU?*

I have this tree analogy when I think of people in my life, be it friends, family, acquaintances, employees, co-workers, whomever...They are all placed inside what I call my tree test. It goes like this:

*LEAF PEOPLE*

Some people come into your life and they are like leaves on a tree. They are only there for a season. You can't depend on them or count on them because they are weak and only there to give you shade. Like leaves, they are there to take what they need and as soon as it gets cold or a wind blows in your life they are gone. You can't be angry at them, it's just who they are.

*BRANCH PEOPLE*

There are some people who come into your life and they are like branches on a tree. They are stronger than leaves, but you have to be careful with them. They will stick around through most seasons, but if you go through a storm or two in your life it's possible that you could lose them. Most times they break away when it's tough. Although they are stronger than leaves, you have to test them out before you run out there and put all your weight on them. In most cases they can't handle too much weight. But again, you can't be mad with them, it's just who they are.

*ROOT PEOPLE*

If you can find some people in your life who are like the roots of a tree then you have found something special. Like the roots of a tree, *they are hard to find because they are not trying to be seen. Their only job is to hold you up and help you live a strong and healthy life.* And if you go through an awful storm they will hold you up. Their job is to hold you up, come what may, and to nourish you, feed you and water you.

Just as a tree has many limbs and many leaves, there are few roots. 
*Look at your own life.* How many leaves, branches and roots do you have? What are you in other people's lives?

THANK YOUR ROOTS! 

By the way, don't waste your time sending this to a leaf, they won't get it anyway.

Thank you for being such an amazing reader.🙏🏼🙏🏼It's been exactly *4 months* that I have started this initiative and a *100+ posts* have been shared along. 🥳🥳🥳

During this period, many people have suggested to have an *open group* for two reasons -
1) Multiple Contribution🤩
2) Collective growth via discussion 💬

Hence, I am creating one open group as *an extension to the existing groups*. 🎯🎯
Needless to say, certain ground rules will be established. 

Over the weekend, I am leaving you with two questions -
1) *Who are you?*🧎
(Answer without name, age, gender, occupation, family, friends, what you did)

2) *Am I willing to learn more or contribute to others?* 
If yes, this is the link 👇🏻👇🏻(the group goes live from July 20, 2020)

A short story to perfectly begin your week with✌️

Once upon a time, in a small village by the winding river, lived a wise sage. Many of the villagers believed that this wise sage had divine powers. He could predict the future!
They would flock to his hut asking him for his advice on a variety of issues. Miraculously, the sage would always have the right answer and the right solution for every problem and every situation brought to him.

THE TEENS WHO THOUGHT THE SAGE WAS A FRAUD
There were a few teenage boys in the village who thought the sage was a fraud and decided to test him. They would take turns to go to the sage and ask him to answer difficult questions. They would ask him about people, places, stars and planets, situations, and almost anything else. Each time the sage would give them the correct answer. The boys were impressed by the sage’s knowledge and wisdom and his gift to know and predict the future.

However, one naughty teenage boy decided to hatch a plan to stump the sage and prove him wrong. He caught a live baby bird and hid it between the palms of his hands. His plan was to go to the sage and ask -“Is this bird dead or alive?”. If the sage replied that the bird is alive, he would crush and kill the baby birdy in his palms and prove the sage wrong! If however, the sage replied that the bird was dead, he would then open his palms to let the bird fly away. *In either case, the sage would be proven wrong!*

He asked the sage – “There is a bird in my hands. Is it alive or dead?” 

*The sage replied – “Well, my dear son, It’s in your own hands! Whether the bird is alive or dead!”*
The boy had come with the intention of proving the sage wrong, but once again the sage gave an answer which was absolutely right! *It was in the boy’s hands – whether the bird will be dead or alive.*

*THE LESSON*
*Here is a question for you. Is your dream alive or dead? Are your goals alive or dead? Well, as the wise sage would answer – “It’s in your own hands!” If our dreams, goals, plans are – kind of dead – we are responsible. If they are alive and we are still working towards them – it is also because of us.*

7/22/20, 9:20 AM - +91 88051 41117: *The Weight of the Glass*

Once upon a time a psychology professor walked around on a stage while teaching stress management principles to an auditorium filled with students. As she raised a glass of water, everyone expected they’d be asked the typical “glass half empty or glass half full” question. Instead, with a smile on her face, the professor asked, *“How heavy is this glass of water I’m holding?”*

Students shouted out answers ranging from eight ounces to a couple pounds.

She replied, “From my perspective, the absolute weight of this glass doesn’t matter. *It all depends on how long I hold it.* If I hold it for a minute or two, it’s fairly light. If I hold it for an hour straight, its weight might make my arm ache a little. If I hold it for a day straight, my arm will likely cramp up and feel completely numb and paralyzed, forcing me to drop the glass to the floor. In each case, the weight of the glass doesn’t change, but the longer I hold it, the heavier it feels to me.”

As the class shook their heads in agreement, she continued, “Your stresses and worries in life are very much like this glass of water. Think about them for a while and nothing happens. Think about them a bit longer and you begin to ache a little. Think about them all day long, and you will feel completely numb and paralyzed – incapable of doing anything else until you drop them.”

*The moral:* It’s important to remember to *Let Go*. 

No matter what happens during the day, as early in the evening as you can, put all your burdens down. Don’t carry them through the night and into the next day with you. If you still feel the weight of yesterday’s stress, it’s a strong sign that it’s time to put the glass down.

*Relax! It's okay to let go*

8/1/20, 10:44 AM - +91 95270 04196: *The Missing Goat, 
"Goat no 3"... wonderful story, please read*

It all started one lazy Sunday afternoon in a small town near Toronto in Canada.

Two school-going friends had a crazy idea.

They rounded up three goats from the neighborhood and painted the numbers 
1, 2 and 4 on their sides.

That night they let the goats loose inside their school building. 

The next morning, when the authorities entered the school, they could smell something was wrong.

They soon saw goat droppings 
on the stairs and near the entrance and realized that some goats had entered the building.

A search was immediately launched and very soon, the three goats were found.

But the authorities were worried, where was goat No. 3?

They spent the rest of the day looking for goat No.3.

The school declared classes off for the students for the rest of the day.

The teachers, helpers, guards, canteen staffs, boys were all busy looking for the goat No. 3, which, of course, was never found.

Simply because it did not exist.

Those among us who inspite of having 
a good life are always feeling a 
"lack of fulfilment" are actually looking for the elusive, missing, non-existent Goat No.3.

Whatever the area of complaint or dissatisfaction, relationship, job-satisfaction, finance, achievements, ...... 
An absence of something 
is always larger than  the 
presence of many other things.

Let's Stop worrying about goat No.3 n enjoy the life...
Life would be so much happier without the worries...

And don't let the non existent imaginary goat number 3 waste your time and happiness.

Enjoy life with what you have.

Stay Safe

8/1/20, 10:50 AM - Aayush Jain: THREE simple yet b
 

‘Healing’ means to let go of the thoughts and feelings that don’t impact us positively.

 

The goal is to neutralize the story from the past, so it loses its power over us. It becomes transparent, with meaning, but no negative effect.

 

Healing cannot happen by attempting to:


•Forget about the past (impossible)

 

•Stuffing or ignoring our feelings (creates other problems like addiction, aloofness, rebellion etc)

 

•Wait for an apology or acknowledgment (blinds us to happiness even during happy times)

 

•Wait for time to heal all wounds (and miss out on everything wonderful till    then? Ughh)

 

•Wallow endlessly in our negative emotions (its depressing)

 

•Redo the past

 

Now, here are THREE simple yet powerful ways to HEAL:

 

1. Learn a powerful lesson from that setback. The lesson should be so powerful that the setback looks worth it.

 

2. Create a powerful goal that needs your 100% focus and energy. Now, you have no time to crib and complain about the past. You have so much to look forward to. 

 

3. Surround yourself with kind yet firm people. Kindness OR firmness is not enough, alone. Together, they are an exceptional combination.

Don’t make any decisions when u r sad.

Just calm or hold on yourselves in such situations and think about your further actions.

Instant reactions are never going to work.

8/4/20, 9:20 AM - +91 88051 41117: Since the time I have made this group, I have always emphasised on how our thoughts create our reality. Making an attempt to broaden our horizon--- 

Japanese surprising research...

1. *Acidity* not only caused by diet errors, but more dominated because of *stress*.
2. *Hypertension* not only caused by too much consumption of salty foods, but mainly because of errors in *managing emotions*.
3. *Cholesterol* is not only caused by fatty foods, but the *excessive laziness* or sedentary lifestyle is more responsible.
4. *Asthma* not only because of the disruption of oxygen supply to lungs, but often *sad feelings* make lungs unstable.
5. *Diabetes* not only because of too much consumption of glucose, but selfish & *stubborn attitude* disrupts the function of the pancreas.
6. *Kidney stones* : .Not only Calcium Oxalate deposits, but pent up *emotions and hatred*
7. *Spondylitis* : not only L4L5 or cervical disorder; but over burdened or *too much worries* about future

If we want to be healthy then first 
1) *Fix your Mind*
2) Do regular *Exercises*, 
2) *Move* around, 
3) Do *Meditation*
4) *Laugh* and make others laugh too.
5) *Make Friends*

*Be Healthy And Enjoy Your Life.* 

There are many sciences which have proved the link between our mind and body. 

And therefore managing things in our mind becomes as important as managing things that appear on your body! 

Have an amazing day!

All theory and no practice makes any concept short-lived!😁😁 
I am experimenting a new way for this group. Once a week an activity will be suggested. Do take some time to reflect upon.⌛⌛ _These have been made from my personal experiences._🙏🏼
The activity will be aimed at how your thoughts can change you at a feeling level and thereafter the reality. 💭💭

*Activity 1- The Concept of anger*
Please recollect a time when you were angry, really angry.😡🤯 Once you realise please reflect on these questions. 

Why am I angry?
Is it because I am wronged by someone?
If yes, what did *I do* to make the person act like that. 

Or
Is it because someone did not do something *I wanted/ expected?*
If yes ask this question *why do I want* the person to act like that? What need am I catering to? 

These were just two examples on how you can shift your negative thoughts to postive thoughts in a challenging situation.

*Negative and Positive co-exist. We can choose which way we handle a situation.* When we change our question from _being a victim of anger to understanding why we are angry,_ the following happens
- energy shifts ⚡⚡
- better understanding of self 😎
- relations are saved 💕
- we protect others from our anger! Yes! 🛡️
- our day goes well 👯

Let me know if this helps in any way ✨✨

8/23/20, 8:18 AM - +91 88051 41117: Hello everyone! 

Sorry for stopping the sharing by group members last week. The energy being shared was not in line with the motto of the group and hence had to cut it.

When we share can we please take care of these few things -

-The message should be relevant for the larger crowd. The message might be relevant for me at that moment, but there are 40 other people who will read it. 💯

-Avoid using a post that has a lot of negative words like "not" "never" "cannot" "hard" "hurt is normal" "don't". 
Personally, I agree we all go through our own ups and downs in life. 📈

-Share post that will motivate a person to be the driver of his life rather than a victim to his situation. We have a lot of negativity going on in news, social media and personally in our head. We do not need to have a group for this feeling.😎

 -This group may not be relevant for all. And that is okay. Even if 10% of the members read the messages, the efforts are worth it. So let the message be for larger good.🤩

- Avoid replying to messages in the group. You may personally reply😀

Lastly, opening the group for contribution ❤️

8/23/20, 3:43 PM - +91 95918 23768: Do yu knw what happens in your body & brain when yu are happy😊 & sad 😔
An emotion of happiness :-  1.Increase in brain center that inhibits negative feelings and fosters an increase in available energy. 
2.Quieting of those that generate worrisome thought. 

This offers a body a general rest as well as readiness & enthusiasm for whatever task in hand and for striving toward a great variety of goal💯🤗 
And vice versa wen yu feel sad i.e., drop in energy level , wen it deepens it approach depression & evn slow down the body's metabolism.

8/23/20, 6:50 PM - Aayush Jain: 'Tell me' is the most powerful way to open a conversation. 

Professional negotiators use those words to build trust-- the foundation of any successful negotiation.  

'Tell me' is the key to learning the other person's perspective. It's the ultimate ice-breaker and rapport builder. 

In a conversation, there are two possibilities:

1. People believe that you are making a genuine effort to understand their perspective.  

2. Or, people believe you are just pushing your own agenda. 

When they believe you are possibility number 1, they are more open to speaking and listening openly. 


When they believe, you are possibility number 2, they are on their guards and never collaborative. 

A therapist says, 'Tell me about yourself' to gain a patient's trust. 

A spouse in a successful marriage says 'Tell me about your day' to engage and share.

A parent says, 'Tell me about your day at school' for the kids to open up and bond.

'Tell me' is fundamental to bonding. It's a secret glue that many people don't practice enough. 


Use 'tell me' as part of every conversation.

9/8/20, 9:24 AM - +91 88051 41117: Thoughts, in and of themselves, have no power—it’s only when we actively invest our attention into them that they begin to seem real. And when we engage with specific thoughts, we begin to feel the emotions that were triggered by these thoughts—we enter a new emotional state which then influences how we act. 

For example, if you regularly engage with the thought that *you’re a failure* and feed more attention to it, you’ll start to feel down, worthless, discouraged and perhaps even depressed.

*_How does your body react to this? You sulk down, slump your shoulders, and project no confidence._*

But if you engage with more *empowering thoughts*, they would boost your confidence and thus trigger a more positive emotional state which will *_then be reflected in how your body reacts: standing up straight, upbeat and energized._*


🗝️🗝️🗝️🗝️🗝️🗝️🗝️🗝️🗝️🗝️🗝️🗝️🗝️
*The Link Between Thoughts, Emotions, and Behaviour.* Everything begins with the thoughts you pay attention to! Thoughts trigger emotions, and the vibrational frequency of these emotions then feed back into the original thought. And as we continue to give mental attention to the initial though, it reaffirms the emotion, which then energizes the thought. *And so we experience a continuous cycle of think, feel, think, feel, think, feel.*

This results in the emotional state you come to experience: stressed, depressed, discouraged, happy, energized, confident, etc

*What are you thinking today?*
9/9/20, 10:23 AM - +91 88051 41117: Happy Morning ❤️

Whatever is there in our heart, that is how we see others.

What we are as a person that is what we see in others. If we have complains about people around us, look within to see!

9/18/20, 9:19 AM - +91 88051 41117: *Forming Opinions of People*

*"How quick we are to form an opinion of a person, to come to a conclusion about them.* It is satisfying to the egoic mind to label another human being, to give them a conceptual identity, to pronounce righteous judgment upon them.

Every human being has been conditioned to think and behave in certain ways -- conditioned genetically as well as by their childhood experiences and their cultural environment.

*That is not who they are, but that is who they appear to be. When you pronounce judgment upon someone, you confuse those conditioned mind patterns with who they are.* To do that is in itself a deeply conditioned and unconscious pattern. You give them a conceptual identity, and *that false identity becomes a prison* not only for the other person but also for yourself. 

*To let go of judgment does not mean that you don't see what they do. It means that you recognize their behavior as a form of conditioning, and you see it and accept it as that.* You don't construct an identity out of it for that person.

That *liberates you as well as the other person* from identification with conditioning, with form, with mind. The ego then no longer runs your relationship." -----From the book *Stillness Speaks* by Eckhart Tolle

9/19/20, 3:21 PM - +91 82756 12195: - Companies like Facebook, Instagram, Youtube, Snapchat, Twitter, TikTok, Google have a business model based on the engagement of people on screen. They work on 'how to get the attention of a person as much as they can' 
- Everything we people do online is being watched, tracked and measured and carefully monitored. Even how long you look at an image or any news item or video.
- Even they have our psychological model and feed the type of engaging us into it. 
- Persuasive Technology is just a sort of design intentionally applied to the extreme where we want to modify someone's behaviour. 
- We are all looking for the moment when technology would overwhelm human strength & intelligence.
- Even 2 friends who are so close to each other, who have almost the same set of friends, they think, 'Im going to the news feed on Facebook, I'll see the exact same set of updates' But it's not like that at all. They completely see the different world as their news feed is calculated by the computer. 
- And then you look over at other side and you think "how can those people so stupid? Look at all the information that I'm seeing constantly. How can be they so ignorant!" 
But the fact is they're not seeing the same information. 
There's a study that shows "Fake News spread 6 times faster than true news"  The algorithms of those apps is biased towards false information. And the harsh truth is FALSE Information makes companies more money than TRUTH. It is a Disinformation-for-profit business model. 
- Now the Question is " DO we want this fake news Disneyland where a targeted lie to a specific community, population, country and Create Cultural wars?"
- "We are a nation of people who have stopped trusting people who support opposite opinions than us." 
- The technology can bring out worse in the society being the existential threat. If technology creates mass chaos, outrage, incivility, lack of trust, loneliness, more polarization, more data hacking, more populism & more distraction from reality.
- Consequences of this in the shortest time horizon is Civil Wars. If we go down the current Status Quo for another 20 years, we probably destroy our civilization through willful ignorance. Well probably fail to meet the challenge of Climate change, degradation of democracies, We probably don't survive i.e. an existential threat to our human civilization. 
So, how to get out of this. Here are simple steps 
1. We should not forward any message or post on social media without fact-checking it.
2. We must run a campaign for making "DATA rights as HUMAN RIGHTS" so that big corporates don't manipulate or sell our data without our consent. 
3. We have to force our government to pass laws that prohibit the use of social media and TV media platforms to be used for an election campaign.
4. We need awareness in our society to transform it into VIBRANT DEMOCRACY.

A Dog's Purpose?
(according to a 6-year-old).

Being a veterinarian, I had been called to examine a ten-year-old Irish Wolfhound named Belker. The dog's owners, Ron, his wife Lisa , and their little boy Shane, were all very attached to Belker, and they were hoping for a miracle.

I examined Belker and found he was dying of cancer. I told the family we couldn't do anything for Belker, and offered to perform the euthanasia procedure for the old dog in their home.

As we made arrangements, Ron and Lisa told me they thought it would be good for six-year-old Shane to observe the procedure. They felt as though Shane might learn something from the experience.

The next day, I felt the familiar catch in my throat as Belker 's family surrounded him. Shane seemed so calm, petting the old dog for the last time, that I wondered if he understood what was going on. Within a few minutes, Belker slipped peacefully away.

The little boy seemed to accept Belker's transition without any difficulty or confusion. We sat together for a while after Belker's Death, wondering aloud about the sad fact that animal lives are shorter than human lives.
Shane, who had been listening quietly, piped up, ''I know why.''

Startled, we all turned to him. What came out of his mouth next stunned me. I'd never heard a more comforting explanation. It has changed the way I try and live.

He said,''People are born so that they can learn how to live a good life -- like loving everybody all the time and being nice, right?'' The Six-year-old continued,

''Well, dogs already know how to do that, so they don't have to stay as long.''

Live simply.

Love generously.

Care deeply.

Speak kindly.

Remember, if a dog was the teacher you would learn things like:

When loved ones come home, always run to greet them.

Never pass up the opportunity to go for a joyride.

Allow the experience of fresh air and the wind in your face to be pure Ecstasy.

Take naps.

Stretch before rising.

Run, romp, and play daily.

Thrive on attention and let people touch you.

Avoid biting when a simple growl will do.

On warm days, stop to lie on your back on the grass.

On hot days, drink lots of water and lie under a shady tree.

When you're happy, dance around and wag your entire body.

Delight in the simple joy of a long walk.

Be loyal.

Never pretend to be something you're not.

If what you want lies buried, dig until you find it.

When someone is having a bad day, be silent, sit close by, and nuzzle them gently.

There comes a time in life, 
when you walk away from all the drama and people who create it. 
You surround yourself with people 
who make you laugh, 
forget the bad, 
and focus on the good. 
So, love the people who treat you right. Think good thoughts for the ones who don't. Life is too short to be anything but HAPPY!

9/29/20, 7:07 AM - +91 88051 41117: An engineer in a car manufacturing company designs a world class car. The CEO is impressed with the outcome and praised him a lot. 

While trying to bring out the car from the manufacturing area to the showroom, they realised that the car is 2 inches taller than the entrance.

The engineer felt bad that he didn't notice this one before creating the car.

The CEO was confused on how to take it outside of the manufacturing area.

The painter said that they can bring out the car and there will be a few scratches on top of the car which could be touched up later on.

The engineer said that they can break the entrance, take the car out, and later re-do it.

The CEO was not convinced with any ideas and felt like it is a bad sign to break or scratch. 

A Watchman was observing all the drama & slowly approached the CEO.  He wanted to give an idea if they had no problem. 

They wondered what this guy would tell them that the experts could not give.

The watchman said "The car is only a few inches taller than the entrance so, simply release the air in the tyre, the height of the car will sink and can be easily taken out"...

Everyone clapped!!!

Don't analyse the problems only from an expert point of view alone.

Life issues are also the same....

Think Simple...
Do Simple and Live Simple

Release *some Air* ... It could be our 'anger' .... our 'disappointments'... our  'egos'... Our 'confusions' ..

In the end it's all about   "Adjusting The Height" ( *Attitude* ), to make things easier in life and uncomplicate the things in life. 

Because Originally we are Happy Souls...

10/10/20, 8:46 AM - +91 88051 41117: *The Daffodil Principle* 

Several times my daughter had telephoned to say, "Mother, you must come to see the daffodils before they are over."  I wanted to go, but it was a two-hour drive from Laguna to Lake Arrowhead "I will come next Tuesday", I promised a little reluctantly on her third call. 

Next Tuesday dawned cold and rainy. Still, I had promised, and reluctantly I drove there. When I finally walked into Carolyn's house I was welcomed by the joyful sounds of happy children. I delightedly hugged and greeted my grandchildren. 

"Forget the daffodils, Carolyn! The road is invisible in these clouds and fog, and there is nothing in the world except you and these children that I want to see badly enough to drive another inch!" 

My daughter smiled calmly and said, "We drive in this all the time, Mother."  "Well, you won't get me back on the road until it clears, and then I'm heading for home!" I assured her. 

"But first we're going to see the daffodils. It's just a few blocks," Carolyn said. "I'll drive. I'm used to this."   

"Carolyn," I said sternly, "please turn around." "It's all right, Mother, I promise. You will never forgive yourself if you miss this experience." 

After about twenty minutes, we turned onto a small gravel road and I saw a small church. On the far side of the church, I saw a hand lettered sign with an arrow that read, "Daffodil Garden."  We got out of the car, each took a child's hand, and I followed Carolyn down the path. Then, as we turned a corner, I looked up and gasped. Before me lay the most glorious sight. 

It looked as though someone had taken a great vat of gold and poured it over the mountain peak and its surrounding slopes. The flowers were planted in majestic, swirling patterns, great ribbons and swaths of deep orange, creamy white, lemon yellow, salmon pink, and saffron and butter yellow. Each different-colored variety was planted in large groups so that it swirled and flowed like its own river with its own unique hue. There were five acres of flowers. 

"Who did this?" I asked Carolyn.  *"Just one woman,"* Carolyn answered. "She lives on the property. That's her home." Carolyn pointed to a well-kept A-frame house, small and modestly sitting in the midst of all that glory. We walked up to the house. 

On the patio, we saw a poster. "Answers to the Questions I Know You Are Asking", was the headline. The first answer was a simple one. "50,000 bulbs," it read. The second answer was, "One at a time, by one woman. Two hands, two feet, and one brain." The third answer was, "Began in 1958." 

For me, that moment was a life-changing experience. I thought of this woman whom I had never met, who, more than forty years before, had begun, one bulb at a time, to bring her vision of beauty and joy to an obscure mountaintop. Planting one bulb at a time, year after year, this unknown woman had forever changed the world in which she lived. *One day at a time, she had created something of extraordinary magnificence, beauty, and inspiration.* The principle her daffodil garden taught is one of the greatest principles of celebration. 

Daffodil garden is one of the greatest principles of celebration. 

*That is, learning to move toward our goals and desires one step at a time--often just one baby-step at time--and learning to love the doing, learning to use the accumulation of time.*

When we multiply tiny pieces of time with small increments of daily effort, we too will find we can accomplish magnificent things.

"It makes me sad in a way," I admitted to Carolyn. "What might I have accomplished if I had thought of a wonderful goal thirty-five or forty years ago and had worked away at it 'one bulb at a time' through all those years? *Just think what I might have been able to achieve!"*

My daughter summed up the message of the day in her usual direct way. *"Start now"* she said.

She was right. It's so pointless to think of the lost hours of yesterdays. The way to make learning a lesson of celebration instead of a cause for regret is to only ask, *"How can I put this to use today?"*

Use the Daffodil Principle. Stop waiting.....

Until your car or home is paid off
Until you get a new car or home
Until your kids leave the house 
Until you go back to school
Until you finish school 
Until you clean the house
Until you organize the garage
Until you clean off your desk
Until you lose 10 lbs.
Until you gain 10 lbs.
Until you get married 
Until you have kids
Until the kids go to school
Until you retire
Until summer
Until spring
Until winter
Until fall
Until you die.

There is no better time than right now to be happy .

Wishing you a beautiful, daffodil day!🌞

10/11/20, 11:23 AM - +91 88051 41117: *POWER OF YOUR THOUGHTS*

A man who has gone out of his town comes back, and finds his house on fire. 

It was one of the most beautiful houses in the town! Many were ready to give double price for the house, but he had never agreed for any price and now it is just burning before his eyes.

And thousands of people have gathered. The fire has spread so far that even if you try to put it out, nothing will be saved. So he becomes very sad.

His son comes running and whispers something in his ear:

"Don't be worried. I sold it yesterday and at a very good price ― three times.

The offer was so good I could not wait for you. Forgive me."

Father said, "thank God, it's not ours now!" Then the father is relaxed and became a silent watcher, just like 1000s of other watchers.

Just a moment before he was not a watcher, he was attached.

It is the same house.... the same fire.... every thing is the same... but now he is not concerned.
In fact started enjoying it just as everybody else in the crowd.

Then the second son comes running, and he says to the father, "What are you doing? You are smiling ― and the house is on fire?" The father said, "Don't you know, your brother has sold it."

He said, "We have taken only advance amount, not settled fully. I doubt now that the man is going to purchase it now."

Again everything changes...

Tears which had disappeared, have come back to the father's eyes, his smile is no more there, his heart is beating fast. The 'watcher' is gone. He is again attached.

And then the third son comes, and he says, "That man is a man of his word. I have just come from him. He said, 'It doesn't matter whether the house is burnt or not, it is mine. And I am going to pay the price that I have settled for. Neither you knew, nor I knew that the house would catch on fire.'"

Again joy is back and the family became 'watchers'! The attachment is no more there.

Actually nothing is changing!

Just the feeling that "I am the owner! I am not the owner of the house!" makes the whole difference.

The Moral :

This simple methodology of watching the mind, That you have nothing to do with it.

Everything starts with a Thought!

Most of the thoughts are not yours but from your parents, teachers, friends, books, movies, television, newspapers.

*Just count how many thoughts are your own, and you will be surprised that not a single thought is your own. All are from other sources, all are borrowed ― either dumped by others on you, or foolishly dumped by yourself upon yourself, but nothing is yours*.

*Sow a thought, you reap an action*.
*Sow an action, you reap a habit*.
*Sow a habit, you reap a character*.
*Sow a character, you reap a destiny*..!

Barely the Day Started and... it's already six in the Evening.
Barely arrived on Monday and it's already Friday.
... and the Month is already Over.
... and the Year is almost Over.
... and already 40, 50 or 60 Years of our Lives have Passed.
... and We Realize that We Lost Our Parents, Friends.
and We Realize it's too Late to Go Back...
So... Let's try, Despite Everything, to Enjoy the Remaining Time...
Let's keep Looking for Activities that We Like...
Let's put some color in Our Grey...
Let's Smile at the Little things in Life that put Balm in Our Hearts.
And Despite Everything, We Must Continue to Enjoy with Serenity this time We have Left. Let's try to Eliminate the Afters...
I'm doing it After...
I'll say After...
I'll think about it After...
We Leave Everything for Later Like ′′ After ′′ is Ours.
Because what We don't Understand is that:
Afterwards, the Coffee Gets Cold...
Afterwards, Priorities Change...
Afterwards, the Charm is Broken...
Afterwards, Health Passes...
Afterwards, the Kids Grow Up...
Afterwards parents Get Old...
Afterwards, Promises are Forgotten...
Afterwards, the Day becomes the Night...
Afterwards LIFE Ends...
And then it's often too Late....
So... Let's Leave nothing for Later...
Because still Waiting see You Later, We can LOSE the Best Moments,
the Best Experiences,
Best Friends,
the Best Family...
The Day is Today... The Moment is Now...

We are no Longer at the Age Where We can Afford to Postpone what Needs to be done Right away.
So let's see if You have time to Read this Message and then Share it.
Or maybe You'll Leave it for... ′′ Later "...
And You'll Never Share it....

*I'm sharing a story today which is slightly deviating from the general motive of this group.* Hope it connects with some members ❣️

✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨
A Monk of the Ramakrishna Mission was being interviewed by a journalist from NY. The journalist had come prepared.
 
Journalist - "Sir, in your last lecture, you told us about Contact and Connection. It's really confusing. Can you explain?"

The Monk smiled and apparently deviating from the question asked the journalist: 

"Are you from New York?"

Journalist: "Yeah..."

Monk: "Who are there at home?"

The Journalist felt that the Monk was trying to avoid answering his question since this was a very personal and unwarranted question. Yet the  journalist said: "Mother has expired. Father is there. Three brothers and one sister. All married"

The Monk, with a smile on his face, asked again: "Do you talk to your father?"

The  journalist looked visibly annoyed.

The Monk, "When did you talk to him last?" 

The journalist, supressing his annoyance said: "May be a month ago."

The Monk: "Do you brothers and sisters meet often? When did you meet last as a family gathering?"

At this point, sweat appeared on the forehead of the journalist. Now who is conducting the interview, the Monk or the Journalist. 

It seemed that the Monk was interviewing the Journalist.

With a sigh, the Journalist said: "We met last at Christmas two  years ago."

The Monk: "How many days did you all stay together?"

The Journalist (wiping the sweat on his brow) said: "Three days."

Monk: "How much time did you spend with your Father, sitting right beside him?"

The journalist looking  perplexed and embarassed and started scribbling something on a paper.

The Monk: "Did you have breakfast, lunch or dinner together? Did you ask how he was? Did you ask how his days are passing after your mother's death?"

Drops of tears coming out started to flow from the eyes of the journalist.

The Monk held the hand of the journalist and said: "Don't be embrassed, upset or sad. I am sorry if I have hurt you unknowingly. But this is basically the answer to your question about "Contact and Connection (Jogajog and Sanjog).
You have 'Contact' with your father but you don't have 'Connection' with him. You are not connected to him. Connection is between heart and heart.Sitting together, Sharing meals and Caring for each other, Touching, Shaking hands, Having eye contact, Spending some time together. You  brothers and sisters have 'Contact' but you have no  'Connection' with each other."

The journalist wiped his eyes and said : "Thanks for teaching me a fine and unforgettable lesson."

This is the reality today. 
Whether at home or in the society everybody has lots of contacts but there is no connection. Everybody is in his or her own world. 

Let us not maintain just "Contacts" but let us remain "Connected."  

The Monk was none other than Swami Vivekananda.

10/23/20, 9:07 AM - +91 88051 41117: *Light*

No one lights a lamp and then hides it or puts it under a clay pot. A lamp is put on a lamp stand, so that everyone who comes into the house can see the light. Your eyes are the lamp of your body. When your eyes are good, you have all the light you need. But when your eyes are bad, everything is dark. So be sure your light isn't darkness. If you have light and nothing is dark, then light will be everywhere, as when a lamp shines brightly in you.

I am my light, and I shine bright.😄✨

10/27/20, 8:03 AM - +1 (630) 962-1953: *When Valmiki completed his Ramayana, Narada wasn't impressed. 'It is good, but Hanuman's is better', he said.*

*’Hanuman has written the Ramayana too!', Valmiki didn't like this at all, and wondered whose Ramayana was better.*

*So he set out to find Hanuman.*

*In Kadali-vana, grove of plantains, he found Ramayana inscribed on seven broad leaves of a banana tree.*

*He read it and found it to be perfect. The most exquisite choice of grammar and vocabulary, metre and melody. He couldn't help himself. He started to cry.*

*’Is it so bad?' asked Hanuman*
*’No, it is so good', said Valmiki*
*’Then why are you crying?' asked Hanuman.*

*’Because after reading your Ramayana no one will read my Ramayana,' replied Valmiki.*

*Hearing this Hanuman simply tore up the seven banana leaves stating*
*Now no one will ever read Hanuman's Ramayana*

*Valmiki was shocked to see this action of Hanuman and asked him why he did this,Hanuman said, 'You need your Ramayana more than I need mine.*

*You wrote your Ramayana so that the* *world remembers Valmiki;*
*I wrote my Ramayana so that I remember Ram.'*

*At that moment he realized how he had been consumed by the desire for validation through his work.*

*He had not used the work to liberate himself from the fear of invalidation.*

*He had not appreciated the essence of Ram's tale to unknot his mind.*

*His Ramayana was a product of ambition;*
*but*
*Hanuman's Ramayana was a product of pure devotion & affection.*

*That's why Hanuman's Ramayana sounded so much better.*
*That is when Valmiki realized that "Greater than Ram...is the name of Ram!"*
*(राम से बड़ा राम का नाम).*

*There are people like Hanuman who don't want to be famous. They just do their jobs and fulfill their purpose.*

*There are many unsung "Hanumans" in our life too, our spouse, mother, father, friends, let's remember them and be grateful to all.*

*In this world, where everyone is highlighting his work and seeking validation, let just do our karma because he who matters, the almighty God, knows without telling him and in the end, it is actually just he who matters.*

_Stay blessed_ 🙏

11/3/20, 7:04 AM - +91 95001 08160: 1. *Your Mind Will Clear*

Our minds are in a constant state of chatter. Sometimes it can feel like a jungle in there! When we take time to be in our own company, we give ourselves the opportunity to clear out a lot of that mental chatter and tune into our inner voice, our intuition. From this place, we can make better decisions and overall achieve a much greater sense of peace and clarity.

2. *You’ll Remember What You Love*

When you spend time alone without the influence of other people you are able to reconnect to the things that you love and make you happy! This can mean doing something creative like painting or drawing, or even a hobby you love that you can’t do with other people. Indulging in your creativity without the influence of others is a beautiful way to connect to your self.

3. *You Will Feel At Peace*

When you spend time alone, you give yourself a gift. Sometimes, the people around us can cause us stress. Family friends, work colleagues can all put pressure on us, whether they mean to or not! When we are alone we have an opportunity to rest and renew.

4. *Your Relationships Will Improve*

It’s interesting to note that by spending time alone we actually get better at relating to others. This is for a couple of reasons, the first being that when you spend time alone, you then value the time with others more highly. Rather than feeling overwhelmed by peoples presence, you embrace it!

Secondly, when we take time alone to understand and value ourselves, we are better able to understand and value others. We build our empathy, compassion and patience. 

While it’s true we all need to spend time with others, its clear that time alone is just as important.


Happpy morning!!

11/4/20, 10:49 AM - +91 82370 92155: A business man was late for his flight. He reached the boarding gate just before it closed. Sweating and out of breath, he scanned his boarding pass at the counter and quickly made his way to the plane.

Arriving at his seat, he greeted his companions for the next few hours: a middle-aged woman sitting at the window, and a little girl sitting on the aisle seat. After stowing his bag above, he took his place between them.

After the flight took off, he began a conversation with the little girl. She appeared to be about the same age as his daughter and was busy with her coloring book. He asked her a few usual questions, such as her age (eight), her hobbies (cartoons and drawing), as well as her favorite animal (horses are pretty, but she just loved cats). He found it strange that such a young girl would be traveling alone, but he kept his thoughts to himself and decided to keep an eye on her to make sure she was okay.

About an hour into the flight, the plane suddenly began experiencing extreme turbulence. The pilot came over the PA system and told everyone to fasten their seat belts and remain calm, as they had encountered rough weather. 

Several times over the next half hour the plane made drastic dips and turns, shaking all the while. Some people began crying, and many―like the woman in the window seat―were praying intently. The man was sweating and clenching his seat as tightly as he could, and exclaim “Oh my God!” with each increasingly violent shake of the plane.

Meanwhile, the little girl was sitting quietly beside him in her seat. Her coloring book and crayons were put away neatly in the seat pocket in front of her, and her hands were calmly resting on her legs. Incredibly, she didn't seem worried all.

Then, just as suddenly as it had begun, the turbulence ended. The pilot came on a few minutes later to apologize for the bumpy ride and to announce that they would be landing soon. As the plane began its descent, the man said to the little girl, “You are just a little girl, but I have never met a braver person in all my life! Tell me, dear, how is it that you remained so calm while all of us adults were so afraid?”

Looking him in the eyes, she said, “My father is the pilot, and he's taking me home."

~~~

There are deep lessons in this story and each will find their own. This is the way I understand it...

The little girl represents our personality. 
The journey, our life. 
The man, the inner commentator. 
The woman, represents the belief in a greater power. 
The pilot, the girl's father, represents our true nature, which is reliably guiding us back home, to itself. 

The more we recognize our true nature and rest in it, the more we will trust our journey even when it gets really rough. This goes beyond believing in a greater power, for the greatest power is not somewhere above us, it is right here with us and within us, it is our true nature. And it doesn't require belief, it requires recognition. 

May this beautiful story inspire you and brighten your path. May you have a happy and colorful journey!

11/7/20, 11:05 AM - +91 88051 41117: *Accepting Compliments*

Many of us find it difficult to accept compliments but easy to believe the slightest criticism. 

Today, right now, let's make a choice to fully accept compliments as we would a gift. Sincere compliments are gifts of praise. 

There is no reason not to accept the gift of a kind word, but some of us *argue against them, even giving reasons why they aren't true.*

✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨
If we visualize the energy of a compliment, we would see beautiful, shining, positive energy being sent from the giver. That energy, if accepted graciously, would brighten our personal energy field. Our gratitude then returns to the giver as warm, fuzzy, glowing energy, completing an even circuit of good feelings. 

But if we reject a compliment, what could have been a beautiful exchange becomes awkward and uncomfortable, making it a negative experience instead.

 Misplaced modesty can ruin the joy of sharing this connection with another person. But we can accept a compliment and still be modest by simply saying "thank you." 

✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨
However, if compliments are rejected due to a lack of self-esteem, then the first step would be to start believing good things about yourself. 

Try giving yourself compliments in the mirror. 

The next step would be to see how it feels to give compliments to others. Notice how great you feel when you've made another person's face brighten and how differently you feel when the gift you've offered is rejected.

*We are our harshest critics.* 
When we accept compliments, we are reminded that others see us through different eyes. All living beings crave positive attention, and we all deserve to have positive energy shared with us.

✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨
You are amazing❣️You are doing great❣️It's a pleasure to be around you ❣️
(Accept it!)
11/8/20, 10:09 AM - +91 98840 14141: Received this Beautiful Message . Should bring a smile to your lips and warmth to your heart.😊😍

Technical Support: Yes, how can I help you?

Customer: Well, after much consideration, I’ve decided to install Love. Can you guide me through the process?

Tech Support: Yes. I can help you. Are you ready to proceed?

Customer: Well, I’m not very technical, but I think I’m ready. What do I do first?

Tech Support: The first step is to open your Heart. Have you located your Heart?

Customer: Yes, but there are several other programs running now. Is it okay to install Love while they are running?

Tech Support: What programs are running?

Customer: Let’s see, I have Past Hurt, Low Self-Esteem, Grudge, and Resentment running right now.

Tech Support: No problem, Love will gradually erase Past Hurt from your current operating system. It may remain in your permanent memory but will no longer disrupt other programs. Love will eventually override Low Self-Esteem with a module of its own called High Self-Esteem. However, you have to completely turn off Grudge and Resentment. Those programs prevent Love from being properly installed. Can you turn those off?

Customer: I don’t know how to turn them off. Can you tell me how?

Tech Support: With pleasure. Go to your start menu and select Forgiveness. Do this as many times as necessary until Grudge and Resentment have been completely erased.

Customer: Okay, done! Love has started installing itself. Oops! I have an error message already. It says, “Error- Program not run on external components.” What should I do?

Tech Support: Don’t worry. In nontechnical terms, it simply means you have to Love yourself before you can Love others. Pull down Self-Acceptance; then click on the following files: Forgive Self, Realize Your Worth, and Acknowledge Your Limitations.

Customer: Got it. Hey! My heart is filling up with new files. Smile is playing on my monitor and Peace and Contentment are copying themselves all over my Heart.

11/24/20, 10:05 AM - +91 88051 41117: *✍ Choose ur Echo wisely.*
 
A man was taking his son on a walk in a nearby forest. Suddenly the boy tripped and feeling a sharp pain, he screams "AHHHH!" Surprised, he hears a voice coming from the mountain, "AHHHH!" He was taken aback as it was his first experience of an echo

Filled with curiosity, he screams: "Who are you?", but the only answer he received was , "Who are you?"

This made him angry, so he shouted, "You are a coward!" and the voice answered "You are a coward!" He looked at his father and asked "Dad what's going on. How's he talking back at me?"

"Son," the man replies, " pay attention. Say something nice to him.

Then he screams, "I love you!"  The voice answers, "I love you!"

Realising his son's confusion the man takes over the conversation with nature and shouts "You are wonderful!" and the voice answered, "You are wonderful!"

The boy is thrilled but still can't understand what is going on.

*The father explains,  Son, people call this an ECHO, but truly it is LIFE.  Life always gives you back what you give out.  Life is a mirror of your actions*. 

If you want more love, give more love.  If you want more kindness, give more kindness.  If you want understanding and respect, give understanding and respect. If you want forgiveness then forgive people who have hurt you. If you want people to be patient with you, then be patient with them

*This rule of nature applies to every aspect of our lives.*

 An echo is nature's way of teaching us to do unto others what we wish them to do to us and wish for others what we wish for ourselves.

Life always gives you back what you give out..

*Your life is not a coincidence, but a mirror of your own doings.*

Choose your ECHO ! Send out blessings and receive blessings in return.

Stay blessed🙏😊

12/12/20, 9:04 AM - +91 88051 41117: *BEFORE YOU COMPLAIN*

*_Whenever you complain about something negative in your world, you reinforce your connection with that negativity. Your complaint can actually focus your energy toward perpetuating and empowering whatever you’re complaining about._*

_A much better strategy is to come up with a positive alternative, and then to act on it. Instead of merely reinforcing what is wrong, you have an opportunity to change the situation for the better._

*_Complaints, because of their negative nature, are usually met with some degree of defensiveness. Positive alternatives, on the other hand, will naturally be met with cooperation and appreciation._*

_The next time you have the urge to complain, stop and ask yourself what it is you really want. Do you simply want to complain or do you want to do something that will improve the situation?_

_Somewhere within each complaint is a genuine desire to improve the situation, but the complaint itself is never enough to do that. So skip beyond the complaint and use your efforts and resources to truly make a positive difference._

*_Make the choice not to aggravate a bad situation with your complaints. Choose instead to transform it with your positive thoughts, ideas and actions._*

🍀🍁🍀🍁🍀🍁🍀🍁🍀🍁🍀🍁
12/13/20, 7:59 AM - +91 88051 41117: My mom did not sleep. She felt exhausted. She was irritable, grumpy, and bitter. She was always sick until one day, suddenly, she changed.
 
One day my dad said to her:

- I've been looking for a job for three months and I haven't found anything, I'm going to have a few beers with friends.
 
My mom replied:
- It's okay.
 
My brother said to her:
- Mom, I'm doing poorly in all subjects at the University.
 
My mom replied:
- Okay, you will recover, and if you don't, well, you repeat the semester, but you pay the tuition.
 
My sister said to her:
- Mom, I smashed the car.
 
My mom replied:
- Okay daughter, take it to the car shop & find how to pay and while they fix it, get around by bus or subway.
 
Her daughter-in-law said to her:
- Mother-in-law, I came to spend a few months with you.
 
My mom replied:
- Okay, settle in the living room couch and look for some blankets in the closet.
 
All of us gathered worried to see these reactions coming from Mom.

We suspected that she had gone to the doctor and that she was prescribed some pills called "I don't give a damn”... Perhaps she was overdosing on these!

We then proposed to do an "intervention" w/my mother to remove her from any possible addiction she had towards some anti-tantrum medication.
 
But then ... she gathered us around her and my mom explained:
 
"It took me a long time to realize that each person is responsible for their life. It took me years to discover that my anguish, anxiety, my depression, my courage, my insomnia & my stress, does not solve your problems but aggravates mine.

I am not responsible for the actions of anyone & it’s not my job to provide happiness but I am responsible for the reactions I express to that.

Therefore, I came to the conclusion that my duty to myself is to remain calm and let each one of you solve what corresponds to you.
 
I have taken courses in yoga, meditation, miracles, human development, mental hygiene, vibration and neurolinguistic programming and in all of them, I found a common denominator in them all...

I can only control myself, you have all the necessary resources to solve your own problems despite how hard they may be. My job is to pray for you, love on you, encourage you but it’s up to YOU to solve them & find your happiness.

I can only give you my advice if you ask me & it depends on you to follow it or not. There are consequences, good or bad, to your decisions and YOU have to live them.
 
So from now on, I cease to be the receptacle of your responsibilities, the sack of your guilt, the laundress of your remorse, the advocate of your faults, the wall of your lamentations, the depositary of your duties, who should solve your problems or spare a tire every time to fulfill your responsibilities.

From now on, I declare all independent and self-sufficient adults.
 
Everyone at my mom's house was speechless.

From that day on, the family began to function better because everyone in the house knew exactly what it is that they needed to do.

For some of us this is hard because we've grown up being the caregivers feeling responsible for others. We never want our loved ones to go through difficult things or to struggle. We want everyone to be happy.

But, the sooner we take that responsibility off of our shoulders & on to each loved one, the better we are preparing them to be MEsponsible.

We are not here on earth to be everything to everyone. Stop putting that pressure on yourself.❤️
12/14/20, 11:16 AM - +91 94206 96635: One of the finest piece that I came across in recent times. The only bird that dares to peck an eagle is the raven. It sits on the eagle's back and bites its neck.  

However, the eagle doesn't respond or fight with the raven. It does not spend time or energy with the raven.   It just opens its wings and begins to fly higher in the  sky.  

The higher the flight, the harder it is for the raven to breathe and the raven eventually falls due to lack of oxygen.  

Not all battles you need to respond to.
Not all arguments or critics you need to respond to or answer back.
Just lift up your standard.
They'll fall off themselves !
 Stop wasting time with the 'ravens'.
 Just take them to your height and they'll fade away.  
The enemy may sit on your back and bite your neck...  But remember, 

"The race is not for the swift, nor the battle to the strong, nor the bread to the wise, nor riches to men of skill, but time and chances happen to them all".

"May Divine Guidance take you to a height where it'll be difficult for the enemies to peck on you."

12/16/20, 7:29 AM - +91 88051 41117: *Closing cycles*🍂🍃
by Paulo Coelho

One always has to know when a stage comes to an end. If we insist on staying longer than the necessary time, we lose the happiness and the meaning of the other stages we have to go through.
Closing cycles, shutting doors, ending chapters – whatever name we give it, what matters is to leave in the past the moments of life that have finished.

Did you lose your job? Has a loving relationship come to an end? Did you leave your parents’ house? Gone to live abroad? Has a long-lasting friendship ended all of a sudden?
You can spend a long time wondering why this has happened.

You can tell yourself you won’t take another step until you find out why certain things that were so important and so solid in your life have turned into dust, just like that.
But such an attitude will be awfully stressing for everyone involved: your parents, your husband or wife, your friends, your children, your sister.
Everyone is finishing chapters, turning over new leaves, getting on with life, and they will all feel bad seeing you at a standstill.

Things pass, and the best we can do is to let them really go away.

That is why it is so important (however painful it may be!) to destroy souvenirs, move, give lots of things away to orphanages, sell or donate the books you have at home.

Everything in this visible world is a manifestation of the invisible world, of what is going on in our hearts – and getting rid of certain memories also means making some room for other memories to take their place.
Let things go. Release them. Detach yourself from them.

Nobody plays this life with marked cards, so sometimes we win and sometimes we lose.
Do not expect anything in return, do not expect your efforts to be appreciated, your genius to be discovered, your love to be understood.

Stop turning on your emotional television to watch the same program over and over again, the one that shows how much you suffered from a certain loss: that is only poisoning you, nothing else.

Nothing is more dangerous than not accepting love relationships that are broken off, work that is promised but there is no starting date, decisions that are always put off waiting for the “ideal moment.”�

Before a new chapter is begun, the old one has to be finished: tell yourself that what has passed will never come back.
Remember that there was a time when you could live without that thing or that person – nothing is irreplaceable, a habit is not a need.
This may sound so obvious, it may even be difficult, but it is very important.

Closing cycles. Not because of pride, incapacity or arrogance, but simply because that no longer fits your life.

Shut the door, change the record, clean the house, shake off the dust.

Stop being who you were, and change into who you are.

12/23/20, 8:31 AM - +91 88051 41117: *4 Hormones* which determine a *human's happiness.*

As I sat in the park *after* my *morning walk,*
My wife came and slumped next to me.
*She had completed* her 30-minute jog. *We chatted* for a while. She said *she is not happy* in life. I looked up at her sheer disbelief since she seemed to have the best of everything in life.
*"Why do you think so?"*
"I don't know. Everyone tells I have everything needed, *but I am not happy.*
"Then I questioned myself, *am I happy?  "No,"* was my inner voice reply.
Now, that was an *eye-opener for me.*
I began my quest to *understand the real cause* of my *unhappiness,*
I couldn't find one.

I dug deeper, *read articles,* spoke to life coaches but nothing made sense. 
*At last my doctor* friend gave me the answer which put all my questions and doubts to rest.
*I implemented* those and will say I am *a lot happier person.*

She said, *there are four hormones* which determine a *human's happiness -*
1. *Endorphins,*
2. *Dopamine,*
3. *Serotonin,*
4. *Oxytocin.*
It is important we *understand these hormones,*
as we *need all four* of them *to stay happy.*

Let's look at the *first hormone* the *Endorphins.*
*When we exercise, the body releases Endorphins.*
This hormone helps the body cope with the pain of exercising. We then *enjoy exercising* because these Endorphins will make us happy.
*Laughter is* another good way of *generating Endorphins.*
We need to spend *30 minutes exercising* every day, read or *watch funny stuff* to get our day's dose of Endorphins.

*The second hormone is Dopamine.*
In our journey of life, we accomplish many *little and big tasks, it releases* various levels of *Dopamine.*
*When we get appreciated for our work at the office or at home,* we feel accomplished and good, that is *because it releases Dopamine.*
This also explains *why* most *housewives* are *unhappy* since they *rarely* get *acknowledged* or appreciated *for their work.* Once, we join work, we *buy* a car, a house, the latest gadgets, a *new house* so forth. In each instance, it *releases Dopamine* and we become happy.
Now, do we realize why we become happy when we shop?

*The third hormone Serotonin* is released when we *act in a way that benefits others.*
When we transcend ourselves and give back to others or *to nature or to the society, it releases Serotonin.* Even,
providing useful information on the internet like *writing information* blogs, answering peoples questions on Quora or *Facebook groups will generate Serotonin.*
That is *because* we will use our *precious time to help other* people via our answers or articles.

*The final hormone is Oxytocin,*
is released *when* we become *close to other human* beings. 
When we *hug our friends* or family *Oxytocin is released.*
The *"Jadoo Ki Jhappi"* from Munnabhai *does really work.*
Similarly, when we *shake hands* or put our *arms around* someone's shoulders, various amounts of *Oxytocin is released.*

*When we are happy, we can deal* with our challenges and *problems better.*

My mother used to cook beans, but before she cooked the beans, she picked the bad and dirty beans and threw them at our backyard and only cooked the good beans.
But when the rain came, the dirty and bad beans became seed and grew up and looked beautiful; interestingly, that same person who threw them away started harvesting them; and she starts to see that the beans she threw away some time ago had value. 

​Now let me tell you​

1. Don't cry when people throw you at the backyard, 
2. Don't cry when they reject you, 
3. Don't cry while they are looking down at you.
4.some may see you as burden.
5.some may say you are too dull.
5.some may say it was because of your past mistakes .Don't worry.

The rain is coming and the same people who are rejecting you will invite you.

God loves even those that are left out and looked down upon.
God will bless you, just stay connected to him and everyone will see how valuable you are.

​Just Encourage Someone

12/29/20, 9:43 AM - +91 98840 14141: Small Tip #1 before we enter 2021

*DECLUTTER*

Digital Declutter 
Remember the number of the plumber from your previous city, you don't need that number do you? Delete it. And delete everything and anything on your phone and laptop that you won't be needing or holds no meaning now, pictures, word docs, contacts et al. 

Physical Declutter 
Clothes that you stopped wearing. Old magazines and books. Accessories you won't use. Give them all away. 

Clutter or things that we don't use over time create a stagnant energy around us. This energy need to be released.
Also, to make way for the new, the old needs to go. 

Love and Light, 

P.S - Some of you may say that abhie toh Diwali pe clean kiya tha sab. Kuch nahi hoga to give away. Do the decluttering anyway. Even if you did it around Diwali. Even if you have very little to give, you'll reorganise the space and create an energy shift.

12/30/20, 7:41 AM - +1 (630) 962-1953: Air Commodore Vishal was a Jet Pilot. In a combat mission his fighter plane was destroyed by a missile. He however ejected himself and parachuted safely. He won acclaims and appreciations from many.

After five years one day he was sitting with his wife in a restaurant. A man from another table came to him and said "You're Captain Vishal ! You flew jet fighters. You were shot down!"

"How in the world did you know that?" asked Vishal.

*”I packed your parachute,"* the man smiled and replied.
Vishal gasped in surprise and gratitude and thought if parachute hadn't worked, I wouldn’t be here today.

 Vishal couldn't sleep that night, thinking about that man. He wondered how many times I might have seen him and not even said 'Good morning, how are you?' or anything because, he was a fighter pilot and that person was just a safety worker"

So friends, who is packing your parachute?
Everyone has someone who provides what they need to make it through the day. 

We need many kinds of parachutes when our plane is shot down – we need the physical parachute, the mental parachute, the emotional parachute, the spiritual parachute & the Financial Parachute.We call on all these supports before reaching safety.Sometimes in the daily challenges that life gives us, we miss what is really important.

We may fail to say hello, please, or thank you, congratulate someone on something wonderful that has happened to them, give a compliment, or just do something nice for no reason.

As you go through this week, this month, this year, recognize the people who pack your parachute. 

😊 *I just want to Thank 🙏 Everyone who Packed  my parachute this year in  2020 ;one way or the other - through your words, deeds, prayers.  Cheers Love and light !!!! *🤗🤗🤗

12/30/20, 9:12 AM - +91 88051 41117: Spilt Milk…
 
Have you heard of the story - spilt milk? Well, we all know there is no use crying over spilt milk. But this story is different. I would hope all parents would respond in this manner.
 
I recently heard a story about a famous research scientist who had made several very important medical breakthroughs. He was being interviewed by a newspaper reporter who asked him why he thought he was able to be so much more creative than the average person. What set him so far apart from others?
 
He responded that, in his opinion, it all came from an experience with his mother that occurred when he was about two years old. He had been trying to remove a bottle of milk from the refrigerator when he lost his grip on the slippery bottle and it fell, spilling its contents all over the kitchen floor - a veritable sea of milk!
 
When his mother came into the kitchen, instead of yelling at him, giving him a lecture, or punishing him, she said, "Robert, what a great and wonderful mess you have made! I have rarely seen such a huge puddle of milk. Well, the damage has already been done. Would you like to get down and play in the milk for a few minutes before we clean it up?"
 
Indeed, he did. After a few minutes, his mother said, "You know, Robert, whenever you make a mess like this, eventually you have to clean it up and restore everything to its proper order. So, how would you like to do that? We could use a sponge, a towel, or a mop. Which do you prefer?" He chose the sponge and together they cleaned up the spilled milk.
 
His mother then said, "You know, what we have here is a failed experiment in how to effectively carry a big milk bottle with two tiny hands. Let’s go out in the back yard and fill the bottle with water and see if you can discover a way to carry it without dropping it." The little boy learned that if he grasped the bottle at the top near the lip with both hands, he could carry it without dropping it. What a wonderful lesson!
 
This renowned scientist then remarked that it was at that moment that he knew he didn’t need to be afraid to make mistakes.
 
Instead, he learned that mistakes were just opportunities for learning something new, which is, after all, what scientific experiments are all about. Even if the experiment "doesn’t work," we usually learn something valuable from it.

1/4/21, 8:16 AM - +91 88051 41117: An Excellent story !!!

The Abundance Principle :  

Once a man got lost in a desert. The water in his flask had run out two days ago, and he was on his last legs. He knew that if he didn't get some water soon, he would surely die. The man saw a small hut ahead of him. He thought it would be a mirage or maybe a hallucination, but having no other option, he moved toward it. As he got closer, he realized it was quite real. So he dragged his tired body to the door with the last of his strength.

The hut was not occupied and seemed like it had been abandoned for quite some time. The man entered into it, hoping against hope that he might find water inside.

His heart skipped a beat when he saw what was in the hut - a water hand pump...... It had a pipe going down through the floor, perhaps tapping a source of water deep under-ground.

He began working the hand pump, but no water came out. He kept at it and still nothing happened. Finally he gave up from exhaustion and frustration. He threw up his hands in despair. It looked as if he was going to die after all.

Then the man noticed a bottle in one corner of the hut. It was filled with water and corked up to prevent evaporation.

He uncorked the bottle and was about to gulp down the sweet life-giving water, when he noticed a piece of paper attached to it. Handwriting on the paper read : "Use this water to start the pump. Don't forget to fill the bottle when you're done."

He had a dilemma. He could follow the instruction and pour the water into the pump, or he could ignore it and just drink the water.

What to do? If he let the water go into the pump, what assurance did he have that it would work? What if the pump malfunctioned? What if the pipe had a leak? What if the underground reservoir had long dried up?

But then... maybe the instruction was correct. Should he risk it? If it turned out to be false, he would be throwing away the last water he would ever see.

Hands trembling, he poured the water into the pump. Then he closed his eyes, said a prayer, and started working the pump.

He heard a gurgling sound, and then water came gushing out, more than he could possibly use. He luxuriated in the cool and refreshing stream. He was going to live!

After drinking his fill and feeling much better, he looked around the hut. He found a pencil and a map of the region. The map showed that he was still far away from civilization, but at least now he knew where he was and which direction to go.

He filled his flask for the journey ahead. He also filled the bottle and put the cork back in. Before leaving the hut, he added his own writing below the instruction: "Believe me, it works!"

This story is all about life. It teaches us that We must GIVE  before We can RECEIVE Abundantly.

More importantly, it also teaches that FAITH plays an important role in GIVING.

The man did not know if his action would be rewarded, but he proceeded regardless. 

Without knowing what to expect, he made a Leap of Faith.

Water in this story represents the *Good things in Life* 

Give life some *"Water"* to *Work with*, and it will *RETURN _far more than you put in_.........!!!*

1/11/21, 8:07 AM - +91 88051 41117: Unlearn to Learn...... 

We must unlearn all the things that confine us to a mediocre life...... We are fed false information by the institutions, family,  media, people and the world around us about what is possible for us, what is good for us and what is not good for us.... 

So the first problem for all of us, men and women, is not to learn, but to unlearn...We must unlearn what we have been programmed to believe since birth.   

Our real enemies are the self-defeating thoughts, false expectations, and beliefs that have us thinking that we have to continue at the same pace, with the same people, in the same company, or direction in life.

One way to find out if the those limiting beliefs and thoughts holding us hostage are real is to test them.  By not testing our belief system, it will own us and become our ruler because we never questioned it.  

So let us challenge ourselves to shift our mindset from self-limiting thoughts to one of possibilities.....There are many things that we must unlearn first -- things we perceive to be true and assumptions we make because of our belief system.   

What are we going to unlearn today?

Adding a quote to the above - 
Alvin Toffler said - 
*“The illiterate of the 21st Century are not those who cannot read and write but those who cannot learn, unlearn and relearn.”*

Challenging our "Programmed Self" is indeed one of the greatest sign of being a "human."

Happy Morning!

Once upon a time two brothers who lived on adjoining farms fell into conflict. It was the first serious rift in 40 years of farming side by side. They had been sharing machinery, trading a labor and goods as needed without a hitch. Then the long collaboration fell apart. It began with a small misunderstanding and it grew into a major difference which exploded into an exchange of bitter words followed by weeks of silence.
One morning there was a knock on elder brother’s door. He opened it to find a man with a carpenter’s toolbox. “I am looking for a few days of work”, he said. “Perhaps you would have a few small jobs here and there. Could I help you?”
“Yes!” said the elder brother. “I do have a job for you. Look across the creek at that farm. That’s my neighbor, in fact, it’s my younger brother and we don’t get along. Last week he dug a wider passage for water into his farm. But he ended up creating a very wide creek in between our farms and I am sure he did it just to annoy me. I want you to build me something so that we don’t have to stand and see each other’s face from across.”
The carpenter said “I think I understand the situation. I will be able to do a job that will please you.” The elder brother had to go to town for supplies, so he helped the carpenter get the materials ready and then he was off for the day. The carpenter worked hard all that day measuring, sawing, nailing.
At sunset when the elder brother returned, the carpenter had just finished his job. The elder brother’s eyes opened wide and his jaw dropped. It was not what he had even thought of or imagined. It was a bridge stretching from one side of the creek to the other! A fine piece of work, beautiful handrails. And to his surprise, his younger brother across the creek was coming to meet him with a big smile and arms wide open to hug him.
“You are really kind and humble my brother! After all I had done and said to you, you still shown that blood relations can never be broken! I am truly sorry for my behaviour”, the younger brother said as he hugged his elder brother. They turned to see the carpenter hoist his toolbox on his shoulder. “No, wait! Stay a few days. I have a lot of other projects for you,” said the older brother.
“I’d love to stay on”, the carpenter said, “but, I have many more bridges to build!”

1/18/21, 7:42 AM - +91 98411 33393: 💖SOME SOCIAL RULES THAT MAY HELP YOU:
1. Don’t call someone more than twice continuously. If they don’t pick up your call, presume they have something important to attend to;
2. Return money that you have borrowed even before the other person remembers lending it to you. It shows your integrity and character. Same goes with umbrellas, pens and lunch boxes;
3. Never order the expensive dish on the menu when someone is giving you a lunch/dinner. If possible ask them to order their choice of food for you;
4. Don’t ask awkward questions like ‘Oh so you aren’t married yet?’ Or ‘Don’t you have kids’ or ‘Why didn’t you buy a house?’ Or why don't you buy a car? For God’s sake it isn’t your problem;
5. Always open the door for the person coming behind you. It doesn’t matter if it is a guy or a girl, senior or junior. You don’t grow small by treating someone well in public;
6. If you take a taxi with a friend and he/she pays now, try paying next time;
7. Respect different shades of opinions. Remember what's the digit 6 to you will appear the digit 9 to someone facing you. Besides, second opinion is good for an alternative;
8. Never interrupt people talking. Allow them to pour it out. As they say, hear them all and filter them all;
9. If you tease someone, and they don’t seem to enjoy it, stop it and never do it again. It encourages one to do more and it shows how appreciative you're;
10. Say “thank you” when someone is helping you.
11. Praise publicly. Criticize privately;
12. There’s almost never a reason to comment on someone’s weight. Just say, “You look fantastic.” If they want to talk about losing weight, they will;
13. When someone shows you a photo on their phone, don’t swipe left or right. You never know what’s next;
14. If a colleague tells you they have a doctors' appointment, don’t ask what it’s for, just say "I hope you’re okay". Don’t put them in the uncomfortable position of having to tell you their personal illness. If they want you to know, they'll do so without your inquisitiveness;
15. Treat the cleaner with the same respect as the CEO. Nobody is impressed at how rude you can treat someone below you but people will notice if you treat them with respect;
16. If a person is speaking directly to you, staring at your phone is rude;
17. Never give advice until you’re asked;
18. When meeting someone after a long time, unless they want to talk about it, don’t ask them their age and salary;
19. Mind your business unless anything involves you directly - just stay out of it;
20. Remove your sunglasses if you are talking to anyone in the street. It is a sign of respect. Moreso, eye contact is as important as your speech; and
21. Never talk about your riches in the midst of the poor. Similarly, don't talk about your children in the midst of the barren.
22.After reading a good message, try to say" Thanks for the message". *APPRECIATION* remains the easiest way of getting what you don't have.

Here are a few of Charlie Munger’s life lessons that I love. I am sure you will like many of them too.
 
CM - “Don’t have a lot of envy”.
NG - Envy makes you feel impotent and helpless. It makes you feel less than who you are. Why would you want to do that, champion?
 
CM - “Don’t have a lot of resentment”.
NG - Resentment is so frustrating. Resentment hurts you and lowers your performance. It makes you lose focus. Why would you want to do that, lovely human?
 
CM - “Don’t overspend your income”.
NG - Spend on needs. Only spend your ‘EXCESS’ money on ‘wants’. Overspending your income is a sure-fire way to stress. Why would you want to do that, dear virtuoso?
 
CM - “You stay cheerful in spite of your troubles”.
NG - Everyone has their share of troubles. Being cheerful makes the troubles weak. Overcoming the troubles is then easy peasy. Being troubled gives you zero advantage. So, why stay troubled you gem of a person?
 
CM - “You deal with reliable people”.
NG - This the best for me. Great things can be done in life when we work with a reliable person. Your greatness will be revealed in full glory when you work with reliable people. Isn’t that right o’ reliable friend?
 
CM - “Do what you’re supposed to do”.
NG - Isn’t this simple and awesome. Why wait for ANYONE to do what we are supposed to do? So go on! Find time for things you are supposed to do. Health, fitness, family, holidays, reading, learning, upgrading…make time for them and be your own sunshine!

*The race*

I was jogging this morning and I noticed a person about half a km ahead. I could guess he was running a little slower than me and I felt good, I said to myself I will try catch up with him.

I had about a km before I needed to turn off. So I started running faster and faster. Every block, I was gaining on him just a little bit. After just a few minutes I was only about 100 feet behind him, so I really picked up the pace and pushed myself. I was determined to catch up with him.

Finally, I did it! I caught up and passed him. Inwardly I felt very good. "I beat him". 

Of course, he didn't even know we were racing. 

After I passed him, I realized I had been so focused on competing against him that I had missed my turn to my house,. I had missed the focus on my inner peace, I missed to see the beauty of greenery around, I missed to do my inner Namasarmarna, and in the needless hurry stumbled and slipped twice or thrice and might have hit the footpath and broken a limb.

It then dawned on me, isn't that what happens in life when we focus on competing with co-workers, neighbours, friends, family, trying to outdo them or trying to prove that we are more successful or more important and in the bargain we miss on our happiness within our own surroundings?

We spend our time and energy running after them and we miss out on our own paths to our given destination. The problem with unhealthy competition is that it's a never ending cycle.

There will always be somebody ahead of you, someone with a better job, nicer car, more money in the bank, more education, a prettier wife, a more handsome husband, better behaved children, better circumstances and better conditions etc. 

But one important realisation is that *'You can be the best that you can be, when you are not competing with anyone.'*

Some people are insecure because they pay too much attention to what others are, where others are going, wearing and driving. *Take whatever you have*, the height, weight and personality. Accept it and realize, that you are blessed. Stay focused and live a healthy life. *There is no competition in Destiny. Each has his own.*

Comparison AND Competition  is the thief of JOY. It kills the Joy of Living your Own Life.

*Run your own Race, play your own game and that leads to Peace and true living.*

*Have a Happy Steady Life*🙏

 *Souls and Karmic Connections* 
We have traveled through many lifetimes and lived with many different souls amid family, friends or those who don't really get along with us. Some may have even tried to harm us emotionally, physically or spiritually. All said and done. We all are the same and belong to only one group that is SOULS. We all have traveled together in different lifetimes and have shared various relationships with each other such as,

Father-Mother
Husband-Wife
Uncle-Aunt
Brother-Sister
Friends
Neighbours
Servants
Drivers and 
even so-called Enemies.

 *Each person is a Soul that tries to help the other move forward spiritually and reduce the Karmic baggage.* 

Sometimes the Soul that loves us the most, might willingly take birth as an enemy or a tormentor in a lifetime, just to help us work out our karma. Thus, a person, who we think hates us and we in return hate, might be our greatest well-wisher spiritually.

He or She may be responsible for our becoming spiritual or compassionate. That very person who is creating hell in our lives may bring us closer to spirituality. In the present lifetime, he/she may be doing so because that could be the only way to teach us a lesson. 

Sometimes, a Soul is reborn just to comfort us and be there in times of need.

So, who is our friend and who is our enemy? They all are part of the Soul-Family who wants to help us and want help in return. Sometimes an opportunity comes in the form of a Disaster. Sometimes, the only way to grow spiritually and in life is through pain, sorrow and turmoil.

That is when Life seems strange.

Hence never form judgments, abuse or hate and never say nasty things about anyone. Who knows we may be harming the Soul who loves us the most spiritually but are not able to recognize it as the soul is wearing a different body in this particular lifetime .
You're so hard on yourself.
Take a moment..
Sit back.
Marvel at your life:
at the grief that softened you,
at the heartache that wisened you,
at the suffering that strengthened you.
Despite everything,
you still grow,
Be proud of this.

"Start a new trend. Stop saying 'Sorry' instead say 'Thanks'. Like in place of 'Sorry I am late' say 'Thank you for waiting for me'.  This will shift the way you think and of yourself and improve your relationships with others who get to receive your 'gratitude' instead of 'Negativity'🍁🍂☘️

He wrote the bank's directors, requesting a meeting in the vault at an hour of their choosing. 

He popped out of the floor to greet them.

2/12/21, 7:59 AM - +91 98840 14141: Relate these 10 Commandments  with our life.... you may find more joy...  

1) Heavy rains remind us of challenges in life. Never ask for a lighter rain. Just pray for a better umbrella. That is attitude.

2) When flood comes, fish eat ants & when flood recedes, ants eat fish.Only time matters. Just hold on, God gives opportunity to everyone!

3) Life is not about finding the right person, but creating the right relationship, it's not how we care in the beginning, but how much we care till the end.

4) Some people always throw stones in your path. It depends on you what you make with them, Wall or Bridge?  Remember you are the architect of your life.

5) Every problem has (n+1) solutions, where n is the number of solutions that you have tried and 1 is that you have not tried. That’s life.

6) It is not important to hold all the good cards in life. But it’s important how well you play with the cards which you hold.

7) Often when we lose all hope & think this is the end, God smiles from above and says, `Relax dear it’s just a bend. Not the end'. Have Faith and have a successful life.

8) When you  are sad, try to cheer up just go to the mirror and say, `Damn I am really so cute` and you will overcome your sadness. But don’t make this a habit coz liars go to hell.

9) One of the basic differences between God and human is, God gives, gives and forgives. But human gets, gets, gets and forgets. Be thankful in life!

10) Only two types of persons are happy in this world. First is Mad and second is Child. Be Mad to achieve what you desire and be a Child to enjoy what you have achieved.

'Andhari Illu' literally meaning home for everyone is a social cause run by a doctor couple the Vinjamuris in Hyderabad, where people can come and stay in their home, no questions asked. There are basic provisions to cook food, take rest and a huge library where one can read and relax TOTALLY FREE! Over the years scores of students, poor and needy have come and benefitted from the place. A true example of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam!

"The Sun and the Cave"
"One day the Sun and a Cave struck up a conversation. The Sun had trouble understanding what “dark” meant and the Cave didn’t quite get the hang of “light and clear” so they decided to change places. 
The Cave went up to the Sun and said, “Ah, I see, this is beyond wonderful. Now come down and see where I have been living.” 
The Sun went down to the cave and said, “Gee, I don’t see any difference.”
When the sun went down, it took its light along and even the darkest corners were illuminated. That's why the Sun couldn't see any difference. 
There is a quote from an old book that says "The enlightened ones can never be sent to hell or pushed into darkness. They carry their heaven on their shoulders all the time".
We thought that heaven is a place where we are supposed to go, perhaps it was a state of mind we were supposed to achieve. 
If you are full of darkness within, full of negativity, fear, and doubt, you become a Cave unknowingly. It's hell within and no matter how much you accumulate, you still remain hollow. 
If you are illuminated like the Sun, then the darkness of the cave wouldn't matter. You could be in the worse of circumstances, you'll still be able to find a blessing somewhere.
You'll be carrying your Heaven with you."

Well ! No one has ever bothered to ask the Hare his side of the story, so let me tell you the story from a different point of view…

I met the Hare and sat down with him for a heart to heart talk.

This is what he had to say after we spent the better part of a balmy summer afternoon getting to know one other.

It was a wonderful experience, believe me..

“Yes, I am the hare who lost.

No, I did not get lazy or complacent.

Let me explain.

I was hopping over the meadows near the hills and looked back to realize that the tortoise was nowhere to be seen.

Assured of my healthy lead, I decided to take a short nap under the large banyan tree near the pond.

The anticipation of the race had kept me up all night.

For days, that old silly tortoise had boasted about his ability to plod for hundreds of miles without stopping.

Life is a marathon, he said, not a sprint.I wanted to show him that I could run both far and fast.

The shade of the tree was like an umbrella.

I found an almost oval rock, covered it with grass, and turned it into a makeshift pillow.

I could hear the leaves rustling and the bees buzzing – it felt they were collaborating and even conspiring to put me to sleep.

And it didn’t take them long to succeed.

I saw myself drifting on a log in a beautiful stream of water.

As I came near the shore, I found an old man, with a flowing beard, sitting on a rock in a meditative pose. He opened his eyes, gave me an all-knowing smile, and asked:

“Who are you?”

“I am a hare. I am running a race.”

“Why?”

“To prove to all the creatures in the jungle that I am the fastest.”

“Why do you want to prove that you are the fastest?”

“So that I get a medal which will give me status which will give me money which will get me food…”

“There is already so much food around.” He pointed to the forest in the distance. “Look at all those trees laden with fruits and nuts, all those leafy branches”

“I also want respect. I want to be remembered as the fastest hare who ever lived.”

“Do you know the name of the fastest deer or the largest elephant or the strongest lion who lived a thousand years before you?”

“No.”

“Today you have been challenged by a tortoise.

Tomorrow, it will be a snake.

Then it will be a zebra.

Will you keep racing all your life to prove that you are the fastest?”

“Hmm. I didn’t think about it.

I don’t want to race all my life.”

“What do you want to do?”

“I want to sleep under a banyan tree on a makeshift pillow while the leaves rustle and the bees buzz.

I want to hop over the meadows near the hills and swim in the pond.”

“You can do all these things this very moment.

Forget the race.

You are here today but you will be gone tomorrow.”

I woke up from my sleep.

The ducks in the pond looked happy.

I jumped into the pond, startling them for a moment.

They looked at me quizzically.

“Weren’t you supposed to be racing with the tortoise today?”

“It’s pointless.

An exercise in futility.

All I want is to be here.

All the best.

1. What do you love to watch, study or read about most?

2. Where are you most organised, disciplined and reliable?
 
3. What do you dream about most?
 
4. What are the top things you spend your time on?
 
5. What brings tears to you and touches your heart?
 
6. What do you do with maximum energy?
 
7. Except for necessities, what do you spend your money on?
 
8. What do you talk about the most?
 
9. What are the memories you cherish the most?
 
10. What happened to you as you did this reflection exercise?

A car ahead was moving like a turtle and not giving me way inspite of my continuous honking!   I was on brink of losing my cool when I noticed the small sticker on the car’s rear!

“Physically challenged; Please be patient.”

And that changed everything!! 

I immediately went calm & slowed down!! 

In fact,  I got a little protective of the car & the driver!!! 

I reached home a few minutes late, but it was ok!

And then it struck me.  

Would I have been patient if there was no sticker ?

Why do we need stickers to be patient with people!?

Will we be more patient & kind with others if people had labels pasted on their foreheads?

Labels like ——

“ Lost my job”
“Fighting cancer”
“Going through a bad divorce”
“Suffering Emotional abuse “ 
"Lost a loved one”
“Feeling worthless”
“Financially broken”

....and more like these!!

Everyone is fighting a battle we know nothing about. 

The least we can do is to be patient, kind & compassionate

Let us respect the Invisible Labels !!

3/8/21, 10:31 AM - +91 98451 59083: I got on to the bus. Seeing the crowd inside, I was upset. There was no place to sit. Just then, a person vacated his seat.The man standing next to the vacant seat could have sat there, but instead he offered the seat to me.
At the next stop, the same thing happened again. He gave his seat to another. This happened 4 times during the entire journey. The man looked like a  normal worker, returning home after a long day at work...
At the last stop when all of us got off, I spoke to him. 
"Why were you giving your seat to another person every time you got a vacant seat?"
His answer took me by surprise.
"I haven’t studied much in my life nor do I know many things. I don't have much money either. So I don't have anything much to give to anyone. That's why I do this everyday. It is something I can do easily. 
"After working all day I can stand for a little longer. I gave my seat to you and you said *thank you*. It gave me satisfaction that I did something for someone. 
I do this daily & feel I am contributing in some way. I go back home refreshed & happy every day that I gave something to someone."
 I was speechless!!! Wanting to do something for someone on a daily basis is the ultimate gift.

This stranger taught me a lot  - 
*How easy it is to be rich from within!* 

*Beautiful clothes, lots of money in the bank account, expensive gadgets, accessories & luxuries or even  educational degrees - may or may not make you rich and happy; but a small act of giving is enough to make you feel rich & Happy everyday*🙏🏼🙏🏼

A Merchant wanted to purchase a gorgeous camel in the market and after spotting one began to setlle for it with the seller!

There was a long bargain between the merchant and the camel seller, and finally the merchant bought the camel and took it home!

On reaching home, the merchant called his servant to take out the camel's kajava (saddle) ..!

Under the Kajave, the servant found a small velvet bag which upon opening revealed him to be full of precious diamond gems ..!

The servant shouted, "Boss, you bought a camel, but look what came with it for free!"

The Merchant was also surprised, he saw diamonds in his servant's hands which were shining and twinkling even more in the sunlight!

The Merchant said: "I have bought a camel and not the diamonds, I should return it immediately!"

The servant was thinking in his mind "how stupid my boss is ...!"

He Said: "Nobody will know who the owner is!" However, the merchant did not listen to him and immediately reached the market and returned the velvet bag to the shopkeeper.

The camel seller was very happy, said, "I had forgotten that I had hidden my precious stones under the Kajave!

Now you choose any one diamond as a reward!

The Merchant said, "I have paid the right price for the camel so I do not need any gift and prizes!"

The more the merchant was refusing, the more the camel seller was insisting!

Finally, the merchant smiled and said: In fact, when I decided to bring back the bag, I had already kept two of the most precious diamonds with me!

After this confession, the camel seller was infuriated and he quickly emptied the bag and began to count his diamond gems!

But after his counted with a heavy sigh of relief, he said "These are all my diamonds, so what were the two most precious ones that you kept?"

The Merchant said: ... 
*"My honesty and my self-respect."*

The seller was dumb-struck!

We have to look within ourselves to find out if we possess any of these 2 diamonds.

*Anyone who has these 2 diamonds, HONESTY AND SELF-RESPECT, is the richest person in the world.*

*I want to remember your Face so that when I meet you in Heaven, I will be able to recognize you and Thank you once again -* 

In a telephonic interview,
the Radio Announcer
asked his guest,
a millionaire,
"What made you
Happiest in life ?"

The millionaire replied :
I have gone through
four stages of
happiness in my Life.
Finally I understood the
meaning of True Happiness. 

The First Stage was
to Accumulate
Wealth and Means.
But at this Stage
I did not get the
happiness I wanted. 

Then came the Second
stage of Collecting
Valuables and Items. 
But I realized that the
effect of this thing
is also Temporary & the
Lustre of Valuable Things
does not last long.

Then came the
Third Stage of Getting
Big Projects like
buying a football team,
buying a tourist resort etc. 
But even here I did not
get the Happiness
I had imagined.

The Fourth time
a Friend of mine
asked me to buy
Wheelchairs for
Disabled Children.
At the friend's request, I immediately bought some Wheelchairs.
But My Friend insisted
that I should go with him and
hand over the Wheelchairs
to the Children myself.
So, I went with him &
gave the Wheel chairs
to those Children
with my own hands.
I saw the Great
Glow of Happiness
on the faces of
those Children. 
I saw them all
sitting on the Chairs,
Moving around
and having fun.

It was as if they had
arrived at a Picnic.

But I felt Real Joy
when I started to leave
and one of the Kids
grabbed my leg.

I gently tried to
free my leg - but the
child stared at my face
and held my leg tightly.

I bent down and
asked the child :
"Do you need
Anything else?"

The answer the child
gave me not only
made me happy
but also changed
my life forever.

The Child said : 
*"I want to remember
your Face, so that
when I meet you
in Heaven, i will be
able to recognize you
& Thank you once again."*

💐🙂

*"THE REAL JOY OF GIVING".*

Salt -VS- Rice...
If you were to cook 3 cups of rice, would you add 3 cups of salt to it?
Certainly not!
So, in every preparation of rice, the grains of rice always outnumber the salt, yet a little salt makes a huge difference/impact in the overall outcome.
In the room in which you currently are, look up at the ceiling... 
What is the size of the bulb compared to the size of the room? It is probably a ratio of 1:5000.
Yet, darkness flees the entire space once the small bulb is flipped on.
If I am the salt of the earth, and the light of the world, then "little me" has the ability to make big things happen..
Sometimes, because we feel outnumbered or overwhelmed at the sheer magnitude of evil or wrong-doers, we then choose powerlessness, and decide to go with the flow, not standing up for what we believe is right.
Little doesn't mean insignificant.
You are significant. Your presence should make a BIG difference. Stop waiting to be on the side of the majority. They may be the majority, but they are the trivial majority, and you are the impactful minority.
They are the rice of the world, and you are the salt of the world..
They are the room and you are the light.
Make your influence felt!
Remember:
You are the world's seasoning, to make it beautiful...
So if we can just do the right seasoning to  make even one life beautiful our life is worth living. Have a blessed day😊
Onwards and Upwards! Be the salt in someone's life today

There is a little town in Mexico called Chamula where shamans started using COCO COLA  in their religious rituals to heal worshipers. 
Pepsi began giving commissions to shamans if they recommended Pepsi instead, 
Now there are 2 rival religious groups based on which soft drink they use.
3/27/21, 8:33 AM - +91 98840 14141: Often the reason people say they can’t do something is that they’ve done things in the past that haven’t worked.

Remember, what matters is NOT YESTERDAY but what you do RIGHT NOW.

Many people try driving into the future using a rearview mirror to guide them. ⬅️ 👀💥 If you do that you’re bound to crash.

Instead, focus on what you can do TODAY to make things better tomorrow.

You are not a manager of circumstance, you're the architect of your life's experience.

Courage is a muscle. The more you demand it within yourself and take action, the more you grow and transform.

Ask God a wish - he will help you with strategies.
Universe Hears what you say. So AIM for Excellence.

You win and You only should WIN.
All Greatness within YOU.

In Kashi Varnasi, people use ASH from cremation pyres, throwing it at each other and smearing it on each other’s faces. 
The ashes are also often mixed with gulal to add some color to the ash. 
As macabre as the tradition may seem, it is actually indicative of the local culture, where death is not something to be feared, but is a path to moksha or salvation.

*Isolation is what the seriously ill are experiencing in hospital.*

Stop saying that you are bored, upset that you can't leave the house; *while everyone in the hospital wants to go home.*

So, thank God if you have to stay at home, because despite everything, with money or without money, with a job or without a job, *you are in the best place you could be, at home, surrounded by who loves you!*

Perhaps it is time to transform your house into a wonderful place to stay, *a place of peace and not of war, of embrace and not of distance.*

Anyway, look with different eyes at the situation you are experiencing !!

*Make your house a party:* Listen to music, sing, dance......

*Make your house a temple:* Pray, pray, meditate, ask, thank, praise, plead ...

*Make your home a school:* Read, write, draw, paint, study, learn, teach ...

*Make your house a store:* Clean, order, organize, decorate, label, move, sell, donate ...
*Make your house a restaurant:* cook, eat, try, create recipes, grow spices, plant a garden ..
*make your house, a place of love.*"

जय जिनेंद्र

हम सभी एक अत्यंत कठिन दौर से गुजर रहे है। हमारे सभी के संपर्क के कई परिवारों में परेशानी चल रही है। 

मेरा अनुरोध है कि सभी एक दूसरे के लगातार संपर्क में रहे। बिना झिझक अपनी तकलीफ और आवश्यकताएं साझा करे। 
हम सब एक परिवार है एक दूसरे से बातचीत करें, मन हल्का होगा। हम सभी इस परीक्षा में साथ है।

यह वक्त भी गुजर जायेगा, दवा से ज्यादा हौसले की जरूरत है। किसी भी परिस्थिति में मनोबल कम न होने दे अपितु दुसरो की हिम्मत बढाये, एक दुसरे की कॉउंसलिंग करें, बातचीत करें।

स्नेह का धागा और संवाद की सुई, 
उधड़ते रिश्तो की, तुरपाई कर देती है...!

*"The lungs represent our capacity to take in and give out life.* 

Problems with the lungs usually mean we are afraid to take in life, or perhaps we feel we do not have the right to live life fully.

Are you a shallow breather or do you always breathe fully? Pause a moment and notice how you are breathing. 

Read the following statements slowly and pay attention to how you feel as you read and absorb each line. Affirm them everyday.

*The breath of life flows easily through me. I am free to take charge of my life. I am entitled to peace.* 
*I love my lungs.*
*I have a right to take up space. I have a right to exist. I take in and give out life fully and freely. It is safe to take in my environment. I trust the Power that supplies my breath in such great abundance. There is enough breath to last as long as I shall choose to live. There is enough life and sustenance to last for as long as I shall choose to live. I now choose the thoughts that create safety for me. I love and appreciate my beautiful lungs!*

----From the books *Love your body and You can heal your life* by Louise L Hay.

 Baby Vedika needs your help to fight SMA Type 1, a disease that usually kills babies before they are 2 years old. 16 crores (USD 2.1 million) is the cost of Zolgensma-the drug for the treatment. We want her to be with us on her first birthday. We request everyone to come forward and help by contributing. Any contribution to her parents will be appreciated. Please support as much as you can. VEDIKA'S CONDITION : Our daughter, Vedika, at a very early age of 8 months, is diagnosed with SMA Type 1, one of the most severe, early-onset forms of Spinal Muscular Atrophy. The disorder attacks the baby’s nerves and muscles, and as it progresses, makes it extremely difficult for them to carry out basic activities like sit up, lift their head, swallow milk, and even breathe. SMA affects 1 in 10,000 babies, and is the #1 genetic cause of infant death worldwide. We, as Vedika’ parents, want to give her, a lively and happy child, her best chance to not only survive, but also live a fulfilled, long and normal life...

When you come in from your walk, take a few moments to absorb the contribution the exercise and the fresh air have made to your day and to your life.

When you finish a meal, sit still for a moment and be conscious of the benefits the food brings to your body.

When someone pays you a compliment, instead of shrugging it off, accept it fully into your being, even revel in it.

When you do something thoughtful for someone else, enjoy not only the pleasure they may derive from it, but the satisfaction it gives you to perform a good deed.

When you complete a project, take some time to acknowledge your accomplishment before you rush off to begin the next one. 

*So many extraordinary things happen to us throughout the day and throughout our lives. We often either ignore them or make light of them as though they were unimportant. They are important. Take the time to notice them.*

✨The little things may take only a moment or two to acknowledge. ✨
✨In a very real sense, these daily events make you what you are. ✨
✨ *Indulge in yourself*✨

5/21/21, 9:10 AM - +91 88051 41117: The twelve gifts of birth

Once upon a time, a long time ago, when princes and princesses lived in faraway kingdoms, royal children were given twelve special gifts when they were born. You may have heard the stories. Twelve wise women of the kingdom, or fairy godmothers as they were often called, traveled swiftly to the castle whenever a new prince or princess came into the world. Each fairy godmother pronounced a noble gift upon the royal baby.

As time went on, the wise women came to understand that the twelve royal gifts of birth belong to every child, born anywhere at anytime. They yearned to proclaim the gifts to all children, but the customs of the land did not allow that.

One day when the wise women gathered together they made this prophecy:
 
Some day, all the children of the world will learn the truth about their noble inheritance. When that happens a miracle will unfold on the kingdom of Earth.

Some day is near. Here is the secret they want you to know.

At the wondrous moment you were born, as you took your first breath, a great celebration was held in the heavens and twelve magnificent gifts were granted to you.

1. Strength is the first gift. May you remember to call upon it whenever you need it.

2. Beauty is the second gift. May your deeds reflect its depth.

3. Courage is the third gift.May you speak and act with confidence and use courage to follow your own path.

4. Compassion is the fourth gift. May you be gentle with yourself and others. May you forgive those who hurt you and yourself when you make mistakes.

5. Hope is the fifth gift. Through each passage and season, may you trust the goodness of life.

6. Joy is the sixth gift. May it keep your heart open and filled with light.

7. Talent is the seventh gift. May you discover your own special abilities and contribute them toward a better world.

8. Imagination is the eighth gift. May it nourish your visions and dreams.

9. Reverence is the ninth gift. May you appreciate the wonder that you are and the miracle of all creation.

10. Wisdom is the tenth gift. Guiding your way, wisdom will lead you through knowledge to understanding. May you hear its soft voice.

11. Love is the eleventh gift. It will grow each time you give it away.

12. Faith is the twelfth gift. May you believe.

Now you know about your twelve gifts of birth. But there is more to the secret that the wise women knew. Use your gifts well and you will discover others, among them a gift that is uniquely you. See these noble gifts in other people.

Mahavir’s ears were pierced with nails. Jesus was crucified and Rama had to leave the palace the day, he was to be crowned. So, look at the problems as an opportunity to further shine yourself. Problems are the paths which take you to glory. Take problems as a maze or a puzzle, work on them to solve them as a game, without losing your mental cool. Never let a problem sit on your head, rather overpower it with your courage and conviction. Make it your habit to do so time and again. More often you do it, more adept you become in it.

6/3/21, 10:43 PM - +91 88051 41117: A story that will help you make peace ✌️ with the bad experiences of your life.  

𝗙𝗮𝗰𝘁 

For generations, the followers of Lao Tzu have been repeating the story and always finding more and more meaning in it. 

There was an old man 👴 in a village, very poor, but even kings were jealous of him because he had a beautiful 😍 white horse🐴. Such a horse had never been seen before – the beauty, the very grandeur, the strength. Kings asked for the horse and they offered fabulous prices, but the old man would say, ‘This horse🐴 is not a horse to me, he is a person, and how can you sell a person?

He is a friend, he is not a possession. How can you sell a friend?’ 🤔 The man was poor, there was every temptation, but he never sold the horse.

One morning, he suddenly found that the horse was not in the stable. The whole village gathered and they said, ‘You foolish old man 😒 We knew it beforehand, that someday the horse would be stolen. And you are so poor – how can you protect such a precious thing? It would have been better to sell it. You could have fetched any price you asked, any fancy price was possible. Now the horse is gone. It is a curse, a misfortune.’😭

The old man said, ‘Don’t go too far – simply say that the horse is not in the stable. This is the fact; everything else is a judgment. Whether it is a misfortune or not, how do you know? How do you judge?’ 🧐

The people said, ‘Don’t try to fool us. We may not be great philosophers, but no philosophy is needed. It is a simple fact that a treasure has been lost, and it is a misfortune.’😰

The old man 👴 said, ‘I will stick to the fact that the stable is empty and the horse is gone. Anything else 🤷 – whether it is a misfortune or a blessing – because this is just a fragment. Who knows what is going to follow it?’🤔

People laughed. They thought 💭 the old man had gone crazy 😠 They always knew that he was a little crazy; otherwise, he would have sold this horse and lived in riches. But he was living like a woodcutter, and he was very old and still cutting wood🪵 and bringing the wood from the forest 🌳 and selling it. He was living hand to mouth.

After fifteen days, suddenly one night, the horse🐴 returned. He had not been stolen: he had escaped to the wilderness. And not only did he come back, he brought a dozen wild horses with him ☺️ Again the people gathered and they said, ‘Old man, you were right and we were wrong😑 It was not a misfortune, it proved to be a blessing. We are sorry 😥 that we insisted.’

The old man said, ‘Again you are going too far. Just say that the horse is back, and say that twelve horses have come with the horse – but don’t judge. Who knows whether it is a blessing or not? 🤷

This time the people could not say much; maybe the old man was again right 🤔 So they kept silent, but inside they knew well that he was wrong. Twelve beautiful horses had come with the horse. A little training and they could all be sold and they would fetch much 🤑 

The old man had a young son, only one son. The young son started to train the wild horses; just a week later he fell from a wild horse and his leg🦵 were broken. The people gathered again – and people are people everywhere like you everywhere – again they judged. Judgment comes so soon!

They said, ‘You were right, again you proved right. It was not a blessing, it was again a misfortune. Your only son has lost his legs, and in your old age, he was your only support. Now you are poorer than ever.’ 😥

The old man said, ‘You are obsessed with judgment. Don’t go that far. Say only that my son has broken his legs. Who knows whether this is a misfortune or a blessing? – nobody knows 💁🏻‍♂️

It happened that after a few weeks the country went to war with a neighbouring country, and all the young men of the town were forcibly taken for the military. Only the old man’s son was left because he was crippled. The people gathered, crying 😭 because from every house young people were forcibly taken away. And there was no possibility of their coming back because the country that had attacked was big and the fight was a losing fight. They were not going to come back.

The whole town was crying and weeping, and they came to the old man and they said, ‘You were right, old man👴! God knows you were right – this proved a blessing. Your son is crippled, but still, he is with you. Our sons are gone forever. At least he is alive and with you, and, by and by, he will start walking🚶‍♂️ Maybe a little limp will be left, but he will be okay.’

The old man 👴 again said, ‘It is impossible to talk to you people, you go on and on and on – you go on judging. Nobody knows! 🙇🏼 Only say this: that your sons have been forced to enter into the military, into the army, and my son has not been forced. But nobody knows whether it is a blessing or a misfortune. Nobody will ever be able to know it.’

Any bad incident of your life is only a fragment. Unless you know the whole story, how can you 🧑‍⚖️? I know it’s difficult to have that zen-like calmness 🧘 but try to have it. Remember entire life is a big-time, an incident which you feel bad today might turn out to be positive in the long term☺️

6/5/21, 12:48 PM - +91 98840 14141: A Zen Story - found this worthy of a forward:

One day one person climbed up a mountain where a hermit woman was meditating. 
She had taken refuge and was asked:

- “What are you doing here alone in such a solitude place?”
 To which she replied: 

- “I have lots of work !”

- “And how can you have so much work? 
I don't see anything around you here...?”

- “I have to train two hawks and two eagles, assure two rabbits, discipline one snake, motivate a donkey and tame a lion.....”

- “And, where have they gone that I don't see them?”

- “I have them all inside here within me...!!

✓ The hawks stare on everything that is presented to me, good or bad, I have to work on them to see only good things. They are my eyes.

✓ The two eagles with their claws hurt and destroy, I have to train them not to hurt. They are my hands.

✓ Rabbits want to go where they want, at the same time they do not want to face difficult situations, I have to teach them to be calm even if there is suffering or stumbling.  They are my feet.

✓ The donkey is always tired, stubborn and does not want to carry the load each time I walk. That is my body!

✓ The most difficult to tame is the "snake."  Although it is locked in a strong cage with 32 bars, it is always ready to sting, bite and poison anyone nearby. I have to discipline it...  that's my tongue.

✓ I also have one Lion.  Oh ... how proud, vain, he thinks that "he is the king." I have to tame him. And that's my ego.
So you see, my friend, I have  lots of work..... “
  
 Think & Reflect ! 🤔
We all may have the same — Lots to work on ourselves !
So Stop Criticising, Evaluating n Judging others ! Let’s First work on ourselves !!

Somewhere between

"Praying for our parents" we finally grew up  

And as we grew up, we realize;

6/9/21, 9:01 AM - +91 98220 51117: *Five men got lost in a vast forest. They tried to find their way out.* 

The first man said, “I will follow my intuition and go left.” 

The second man said, “I will go right. I have a strong feeling about this.” 

The third man said, “I think I will walk back the same path we came. This should be the safest option.” 

The fourth man said: “I think we are on the right track already, so I will keep going straight. I am sure this forest will end and I will find a village or a farm to ask for directions.” 

The fifth man said, “I don’t know what to do. I think I will climb up this tall tree and take a better look around before I make up my mind.” 

So the fifth man did that. While he was climbing, the other four men scattered towards their own directions. The fifth man now could see from above what was the shortest way to a village. He thought that the others should not have chosen the paths they did. He was wrong, though. 

Each man chose his own path and gained a different experience. The man who went left, found a long path but in the end, it led him to the town. 

The man who went right, had to fight a pack of wolves, but this way he learned how to survive in the forest. 

The man who went back, met another team of hikers and he made new friends. 

The man who went straight, found indeed a farm and was hosted by the family for a couple of days before leaving for the village.

Everyone was enriched in their own unique way by the journey. 

~~~ 

Some reflections on this story... 

What if, there are no "right" or "wrong" decisions? 

Could it be that every decision offers us new experiences, which in turn offers us innumerable further opportunities for growth? 

It has taken every decision of our life to bring us to where we are right now. In the fullness of the present, are we really in the wrong place? Even if it feels so, can we be sure? 

*What if there are no mistakes? Only opportunities?*

Your nose can remember different scents.
Your bones are ounce for ounce stronger than steel.
Your eye can distinguish different colours.
Your heartbeat changes and mimics the music you listen to!
So, next time you are focusing on pain or illness take out a pen and write down what is functioning perfectly in your body. At any given moment, your body is doing so many things the right way, so stop fixating on a problem. Take notice of what happens in your body as you write your list of appreciation.

Ganga Datt passed away recently and at that time Mr. Poonawala was in Mumbai for some important work.  As soon as he heard the news, he cancelled all his meetings, & requested the driver's family to wait him for the cremation and came back to Pune immediately by a helicopter.

On reaching Pune, he asked the Limousin to be decorated with flowers, as he wished Ganga Datt should be taken in the same car which he himself had driven since the beginning. 
When Ganga Datt's family agreed to his wishes, he himself drove Ganga Datt from his home up to the ghat on his last journey.

When asked about it, Mr. Poonawala replied that _Ganga Datt had served him day and night, and he could at least do this being eternally grateful to him._ 
_He further added that Ganga Datt rose up from poverty and educated both his children very well. His daughter is a Chartered accountant and that is so commendable._

His comment in the end, is the essence of a successful life in all aspects: *Everybody earns money which is nothing unusual in that, but we should always be grateful to those people who contribute to our success. This is the belief, we have been brought up with, which made me do, what I did.*

If you have a notion that it comes only from one direction, you will miss all of these other opportunities because you want happiness to come only from the direction you want. You say, ‘I would rather die than marry anyone but her. I would rather die than lose my job, my reputation. I cannot be happy if I don’t get that degree or that promotion or that house.’ You have put many conditions on your happiness. And then, even if you do have all your conditions met, you still won’t be happy. You will just keep creating new conditions for your happiness. You will still want the higher degree, the better job and the more beautiful house. Please remember that your notions of happiness may be very dangerous. The Buddha said happiness can only be possible in the here and now.

"Talk is cheap. Actions speak. Doesn't matter what you start.

It's brilliant that you have the courage to take that first step (nothing changes until you change). But what's the point of starting if you don't finish?

Leadership and greatness comes to those who follow-through; who stand for near-flawless execution; who stay with a project, a pursuit or an idea with the tenacity of a pit bull until the thing gets done, beautifully.

So right here, right now, reach deep into your heart. And commit from the best place that inhabits you -- to finish the important things you start.

Because anyone can take the first step. But only the remarkable ones stay on the path until they complete the 1000th one.

 *You can't win if you don't begin."* 

-----From the book Little black book for Stunning Success by Robin Sharma.

Is there something you have begun that you'd like to finish?

*The story of the donkey & the tiger..*

*_(Author unknown)._*

The donkey told the tiger: ′′The grass is blue". 
The tiger replied: ′′No, the grass is green".
The discussion became heated up & the two decided to submit the issue to arbitration & to do so, they approached the lion, the King of the jungle. 
Before reaching the clearing in the forest where the lion was sitting on his throne, the donkey started screaming: ′′Your Highness, is it true that grass is blue?".
The lion replied: "True, the grass is blue". 
The donkey rushed forward & continued: ′′The tiger disagrees with me & contradicts me & annoys me. Please punish him".
The King then declared: ′′The tiger will be punished with 5 years of silence".
The donkey jumped up with joy & went on his way, content & repeating: ′′The grass is blue"...
The tiger accepted his punishment, but he asked the lion: ′′Your Majesty, why have you punished me; after all, the grass is green?"
The lion replied: ′′In fact, the grass is green".
The tiger asked: ′′So why do you punish me?"
The lion replied: ′′That has nothing to do with the question of whether the grass is blue or green. The punishment is, because it is not possible for a brave, intelligent creature like you, to waste time arguing with a donkey & on top of that, to come & bother me with that question".

*Moral:*
The worst waste of time, is arguing with the fools & fanatics, who don't care about truth or reality, but only the victory of their beliefs & illusions.
Never waste time on discussions that make no sense. There are people, who for all the evidence presented to them, do not have the ability to understand & there are others, who are blinded by ego, hatred & resentment & the only thing that they want, is to be right, even if they aren’t.
When ignorance screams, intelligence shuts up.
Your peace & tranquility are worth more.

*_Think about it._*
Cheers.

If you’re eating with others, take the time to really look at each of them and smile. Sitting at the table with other people is a chance to offer an authentic smile of friendship and understanding. It’s very easy, but not many people do it. To me, the most important part of the practice is to look at each person and smile. If people eating together cannot smile at each other, then something isn’t right.

*Die empty*

The most beautiful book to read is "Die Empty" by Todd Henry.
The author was inspired and got this idea of writing ​​this book while attending a business meeting. 
When the director asked the audience: "Where is the richest land in the world?"
One of the audience answered: "Oil-rich Gulf states." 
Another added: "Diamond mines in Africa."
Then the director said: "No it is the cemetery. Yes, it is the richest land in the world, because millions of people have departed/died and they carried many valuable ideas that did not come to light nor benefit others. It is all in the cemetery where they are buried."

Inspired by this answer, Todd Henry wrote his book, "Die empty" where he did his best to motivate people to pour out their ideas and potential energies in their communities and turn them into something useful before it is too late.

The most beautiful of what he said in his book is: "Do not go to your grave and carry inside you the best that you have.
 *Always choose to die empty.*

The TRUE meaning of this  expression, is to die empty of all the goodness that is within you. Deliver it to the world, before you leave.

If you have an idea perform it.
If you have knowledge give it out.
If you have a goal achieve it.
Love, share and distribute, do not keep it inside.

Let’s begin to give. Remove and spread every atom of goodness inside us.

Start the race.

Have you noticed how Google Maps never yells, condemns or castigates you if you take the wrong turn?

It never raises its voice and says, “You were supposed to go LEFT at the last crossing, you idiot! Now you’re going to have to go the LONG way around and it’s going to take you SO much more time, and you’re going to be late for your meeting! Learn to pay attention and listen to my instructions, OK?”
 
If it did that, chances are, a lot of us might stop using it. But Google simply Reroutes and shows you the next best way to get there. Its primary interest is in getting you to reach your goal, not in making you feel bad for having made a mistake.

There’s a great lesson… It’s tempting to unload our frustration and anger on those who have made a mistake, especially those we are close to & familiar with. But the wisest choice is to help in fixing the problem, not to blame. 
One may follow Re-Routing moments With others, and also with your own self.

Keep re-routing and keep making friends. Happy friendships day to you all !!

*The First Dosa Rule*

If you’ve ever made dosas, you know the rule: the first one always goes to the bin… Or to an impatient, hungry kid hanging around you.
I have no idea why, but the first dosa never looks good. It’s never round and it’s either burnt or undone.

The really interesting part is how we react to this weird rule of nature: *everybody just kind of accepts that in order to make bunch of perfect dosas, you need to screw the first one up.*
With dosas, we accept failure as an ingredient for success. Yet with life, we react opposite: we fear failure so much we don’t even start cooking.

*The lesson to learn here....*
It usually (if not always)takes a few missed attempts to achieve your dreams or goals or become successful in life.

And all those bad dosas help us to grow, improve and get closer to what we were meant to do.

*Managing failure and learning from it, rather than falling into despair and giving up, is one of the most crucial skills you can develop.* It takes a lot of humility, but it pays off big time.
*So whatever you do, keep trying.*
You will make that perfect dosa, promise.

9/5/21, 8:33 AM - +91 88051 41117: *What follows “I Am” ?*

Have you ever considered the power of the statement, “I am”?

What follows these two simple words will determine what kind of life you live. 
“I am blessed. 
I am strong. 
I am healthy.” 
Or, “I am slow. 
I am unattractive. 
I am stupid.” 

The “I am’s” that are coming out of your mouth will bring either success or failure. 

All through the day the power of “I am” is at work in our minds. 

Many times we use the power of “I am” against us. We don’t realize how it’s affecting our future.

Here’s the principle. 
'What follows the “I am” will always come looking for you.'

The good news is that you get to choose what follows the “I am.” 
When you go through the day saying, 
“I am blessed,” - blessings come looking for you. 
“I am talented.” - Talent comes looking for you. 
You may not feel up to par but when you say, 
“I am healthy,” - health starts heading your way. 
“I am strong.” - Strength starts tracking you down.

You’re inviting that into your life. 

Get up in the morning and invite good things into your life. 

Declare 
“I am blessed. 
I am strong. 
I am talented. 
I am disciplined. 
I am focused. 
I am prosperous.”

9/13/21, 4:42 PM - +91 88051 41117: "The greatest gift you were ever given was the gift of your imagination. Within your magical inner realm is the capacity to have all of your wishes fulfilled. Here in your imagination lies the greatest power you will ever know. It is your domain for creating the life that you desire and the best part of it is that you are the monarch with all of the inherent powers to rule your world as you desire. 

Look around you. Everything that you can experience with your senses was once in someone's imagination. In order for something to get into this world where things exist and are proved, they must first be placed firmly into your imagination. Without your imagination as the reason for future creations, the process of creativity is halted. You have this great power within you. It is a power that is virtually unlimited, and it has been given to you as your birthright. You know that you have an imagination. It is up to you to use this magnificent endowment to work in the creation of all that you choose to place in your imagination. With faith, place into your imagination thoughts that you would want materialised."

9/17/21, 9:58 AM - +91 88051 41117: *September Affirmation* 

I love this life I have created and the people I am sharing it with.
I joyfully receive all the good that Life has to offer with open, loving arms.

Every resource I need for my healing on any level comes to me easily and quickly. 

If there is a health concern, I am guided to anyone or any help I need for my complete health and well-being. If there is a spiritual need, Divine assistance is available to me as soon as I ask. 

When there is a lack of harmony in a relationship, I have only to have the intention for emotional healing and it is set in motion. I am willing to forgive myself and others. 

If there is a financial need, I trust the abundance of Spirit to provide for all I need. The entire Universe is ready to assist me in
my growth. I open my mind to that help and welcome it with gratitude.

And so it is🙏🏻✨🪄

9/19/21, 10:23 AM - +91 88051 41117: my brain and
heart divorced

a decade ago

over who was
to blame about
how big of a mess
I have become

eventually,
they couldn't be 
in the same room
with each other 

now my head and heart 
share custody of me

I stay with my brain 
during the week

and my heart 
gets me on weekends

they never speak to one another
 
    - instead, they give me
the same note to pass
to each other every week 

and their notes they
send to one another always 
says the same thing:

"This is all your fault"

on Sundays
my heart complains
about how my 
head has let me down
in the past

and on Wednesday
my head lists all
of the times my 
heart has screwed
things up for me 
in the future

they blame each
other for the 
state of my life

there's been a lot
of yelling - and crying

so,

    lately, I've been
spending a lot of 
time with my gut

who serves as my
unofficial therapist

most nights, I sneak out of the
window in my ribcage

and slide down my spine
and collapse on my 
gut's plush leather chair
that's always open for me

~ and I just sit sit sit sit
until the sun comes up

last evening, 
my gut asked me
if I was having a hard
time being caught 
between my heart
and my head

I nodded

I said I didn't know
if I could live with 
either of them anymore

"my heart is always sad about
something that happened yesterday
while my head is always worried
about something that may happen tomorrow," 
I lamented

my gut squeezed my hand

"I just can't live with
my mistakes of the past
or my anxiety about the future,"
I sighed

my gut smiled and said:

"in that case, 
you should 
go stay with your 
lungs for a while,"

I was confused
  - the look on my face gave it away

"if you are exhausted about
your heart's obsession with
the fixed past and your mind's focus
on the uncertain future

your lungs are the perfect place for you

there is no yesterday in your lungs
there is no tomorrow there either

there is only now
there is only inhale
there is only exhale
there is only this moment

there is only breath

and in that breath
you can rest while your
heart and head work 
their relationship out."

this morning,
while my brain
was busy reading
tea leaves

and while my
heart was staring
at old photographs 

I packed a little
bag and walked
to the door of 
my lungs

before I could even knock
she opened the door
with a smile and as
a gust of air embraced me
she said

"what took you so long?"

9/24/21, 5:04 PM - +91 88051 41117: *What follows “I Am” ?*

Have you ever considered the power of the statement, “I am”?

What follows these two simple words will determine what kind of life you live. 
“I am blessed. 
I am strong. 
I am healthy.” 
Or, “I am slow. 
I am unattractive. 
I am stupid.” 

The “I am’s” that are coming out of your mouth will bring either success or failure. 

All through the day the power of “I am” is at work in our minds. 

Many times we use the power of “I am” against us. We don’t realize how it’s affecting our future.

Here’s the principle. 
'What follows the “I am” will always come looking for you.'

The good news is that you get to choose what follows the “I am.” 
When you go through the day saying, 
“I am blessed,” - blessings come looking for you. 
“I am talented.” - Talent comes looking for you. 
You may not feel up to par but when you say, 
“I am healthy,” - health starts heading your way. 
“I am strong.” - Strength starts tracking you down.

You’re inviting that into your life. 

Get up in the morning and invite good things into your life. 

Declare 
“I am blessed. 
I am strong. 
I am talented. 
I am disciplined. 
I am focused. 
I am prosperous.” 
And always make sure God’s truth follows “I am”! 

*That's how Laws of Attraction work!*

I AM TRULY Blessed!

Stay blessed Forever.

10/20/21, 10:13 AM - +91 88051 41117: What should we do with HURTFUL thorns?
A thorn pricks your feet. What will you do with the thorns?

a. Will you keep holding it in your hand?
b. Will you frame it as a trophy?
c. Will you throw it? 

The answer is obvious.


The thorns are of no use to you. Neither are you of any use to the thorns. Then, why keep it?


_It was a great relationship_ For some reason, good or bad, things didn’t work out. Both of you are no more ‘right’ for each other. Stop bickering. Move on. 

We WILL NOT store the thorns that have outlived their purpose.
 

– When a ‘core’ employee is not sincere anymore, what do you do?

Hold on to them and look the other way around? Hope that he will change by himself.

We WILL NOT store that thorn that has outlived its purpose.


– A pen has a broken nib. It has outlived its purpose.
– A fax machine at the office has outlived its purpose.
– A shoe that is badly worn out has outlived its purpose.


Throw away the thorn. Let go. Say ‘bye’.

Let go of everything that has outlived its purpose. Once upon a time, it might have been valuable. Today it is junk.

 _-Silence your tears_ 
 _-Swallow "the bitter pill"_ 
 _-Shut your mouth!_ 
 _-Silence your heart_ 

 _But the body speaks, oh does it speak!_ 

It speaks through the fingers, tapping on the table surface!
It speaks through restless feet in bed!
It speaks through a nasty headache
It speaks through gastritis, reflux, and anxiety
It speaks through a knot on your throat
It speaks through anguish and a wrinkle on the forehead.
It speaks through insomnia or too much sleeping.

 _You might silence your voice, but the inner dialogue begins!_ 

People get ill because they harbor and keep undigested issues in their hearts...

 _Expression soothes the soul!_ 

 _Pain isn't meant to be lived forever!_ 
 _Pain is a comma!_ 

So write a letter, a poem, a book! Sing a song.
Pick up your shoes and tap dance!
Make a joke, create a text, paint a canvas, meet with your friends, even if it has to be virtual...
Jog in the park.

Speak with your therapist, converse with God... Be an Artist!

Talk to yourself, to your puppy, scream to the Heavens, 

 _BUT DON'T BE SILENCED!!!_ 

Because if you swallow everything that you feel, you will end up drowning!

 _THE HEART IS NOT A WAREHOUSE!_ ❤

And the body speaks!

12/5/21, 12:23 PM - +91 88051 41117: Located at the base of the spine, the pelvic floor, and the first three vertebrae, the root chakra is responsible for your sense of safety and security on this earthly journey. The word Muladhara breaks down into two Sanskrit words: Mula meaning “root” and Adhara, which means “support” or “base.”

Imbalances in the Root Chakra
If there is an imbalance in the root chakra you may experience anxiety disorders, fears, or nightmares. Physical imbalances may manifest as problems in the colon, with the bladder, with elimination, or with lower back, leg, or feet issues. In men, prostate problems may occur. Eating disorders may also be a sign of a root chakra imbalance.

The root chakra is comprised of whatever grounds you to stability in your life. This includes your basic needs such as food, water, shelter, and safety, as well as your more emotional needs such as letting go of fear. 


Stating three ways to help balance the chakra

1) The affirmation stated above

2) Yoga Asanas that help to open and align Muladhara are -
Pavanamuktasana, knee to chest pose
Janu Sirsansana, head to knee Pose
Padmasana, lotus flexion
Malasana, squatting position

3) Chanting or toning sounds create vibrations in the body, and these vibrations help the cells work together in synchronistic harmony. The mantra sound that corresponds to the root chakra is LAM.

If you want to know whether a DIAMOND is real, BREATHE on it.

Diamonds are very efficient HEAT CONDUCTORS, so the FOG from your breath will DISAPPEAR almost immediately if it is REAL!! 

If the fog sticks around a few sconds before clearing up, the rock is most  probably a FAKE.

12/30/21, 8:44 AM - +91 98411 33393: My musing today 

As the year draws to a close, you start thinking of the year gone by.

When thinking about life, remember this: No amount of guilt can solve the past, and no amount of anxiety can change the future.

When the things you did not ask to happen have placed a heavy burden on your heart and mind, it is okay to take time to rest and to breathe practicing the art of surrender, the bravery of trusting, for this, right here, is *peace in uncertainty.*

It is not acting as though
the unknown does not
exist, but it is finding freedom from the fear and disturbance of it, knowing well within the soul the unknown is still unknown, but it has no hold on you,  it has no hold on the present moment, you are still free to rest and breathe here... To calm your anxious mind.

Listen to the wind, it talks, Listen to the silence, it speaks, listen to your heart, it knows....Sometimes you just need to spend time alone to find out who are you and what you really want in life.

Everything works better if you unplug it and shut it down, including yourself. Do it, detox your body, mind and soul and gather your strength to face the upcoming year with renewed confidence...!!!

Human Body is made of many elements. In our blood  there  are  traces  of 
GOLD, SILVER, IRON, even NITROGEN

1/7/22, 12:14 PM - +91 98220 51117: *"I want to remember your face so that when I meet you in heaven, I will be able to recognise you and thank you once again."*

When Nigerian billionaire Femi Otedola in a telephone interview, was asked by the radio presenter, "Sir what can you remember made you a happiest man in life?"

Femi said:
"I have gone through four stages of happiness in life and finally I understood the meaning of true happiness."

The first stage was to accumulate wealth and means. But at this stage I did not get the happiness I wanted.

Then came the second stage of collecting valuables and items. But I realised that the effect of this thing is also temporary and the lustre of valuable things does not last long.

Then came the third stage of getting big projects. That  was when I was holding 95% of diesel supply in Nigeria and Africa. I was also the largest vessel owner in Africa and Asia. But even here I did not get the happiness I had imagined. 

The fourth stage was the time a friend of mine asked me to buy wheelchair for some disabled children. Just about 200 kids. 

At the friend's request, I immediately bought the wheelchairs. 

But the friend insisted that I go with him and hand over the wheelchairs to the children. I got ready and went with him. 

There I gave these wheel chairs to these children with my own hands. I saw the strange glow of happiness on the faces of these children. I saw them all sitting on the wheelchairs, moving around and having fun. 

It was as if they had arrived at a picnic spot where they are sharing a jackpot winning.

I felt REAL joy inside me. When I decided to leave one of the kids grabbed my legs. I tried to free my legs gently but the child stared at my face and held my legs tightly.

I bent down and asked the child: Do you need something else?

The answer this child gave me not only made me happy but also changed my attitude to life completely. This child said: 
"I want to remember your face so that when I meet you in heaven, I will be able to recognise you and thank you once again."

What would you be remembered for after you leave that office or place?

Will anyone desire to see your face again where it all matters?

*This is a must read piece. It got me thinking.  I am sending it to all my friends. I pray it does same to everyone.*

During his search he found a huge cache of
ROMAN TREASURE, including 15,234 coins.
The British government gave him and the owner of the land £1.75 million for finding it.
Later on, he found his hammer too!

-Silence your tears
-Swallow "the bitter pill"
-Shut your mouth!
-Silence your heart

But the body speaks, oh does it speak!
It speaks through the fingers, tapping on the table surface!
It speaks through restless feet in bed!
It speaks through a nasty headache
It speaks through gastritis, reflux, and anxiety
It speaks through a knot on your throat
It speaks through anguish and a wrinkle on the forehead.
It speaks through insomnia or too much sleeping.
You might silence your voice, but the inner dialogue begins!

People get ill because they harbor and keep undigested issues in their hearts...
Expression soothes the soul!

Pain isn't meant to be lived forever! 
Pain is a comma! 
So write a letter, a poem, a book! Sing a song.
Pick up your shoes and tap dance!
Make a joke, create a text, paint a canvas, meet with your friends, even if it has to be virtual...
Jog in the park.
Speak with your therapist, converse with God... Be an Artist!Talk to yourself, to your puppy, scream to the Heavens, 

BUT DON'T BE SILENCED!!!

Because if you swallow everything that you feel, you will end up drowning!

THE HEART IS NOT A WAREHOUSE! 

And the body speaks!
1/12/22, 11:48 AM - +91 86051 10785: Amma, I am going to the Mall along with my wife and daughter." 

"OK Son.  You go ahead.  Already my legs are paining. I am not interested in coming to the Mall. You go ahead." 

"Grandma, you should also come" insisted the grand daughter... 

"Grandma cannot climb all those steps in the Mall.  
She does not know how to use the escalator.  
As there are no temples there, *Grandma would not be interested. She is interested only in going to temples"* said the daughter in law. 

Though Grandma agreed with this statement, Grand daughter was adamant.  
She refused to go to the Mall if Grandma was not accompanying them.  
Though Grandma repeated that she was not interested, she had to comply with her dear ten year old granddaughter's will.  
She agreed to accompany them. 

The granddaughter was very happy.  
Before her parents could get ready, the oldest and the youngest were ready.  

The youngster took her grandma to the front room.  
She drew two parallel lines, a foot apart.  She told her grandmother that it was a game and the old lady had to pretend that she was a Crane (Bird).
She had to keep one leg within the lines and raise the other leg by three inches.  
"What is this my dear?"  asked Grandma..."
"This is the Crane game Grandma.  I will show you how to play."                              Both of them played a few times and before the father could bring out the Car....Grandma became adept in the game. 

They reached the Mall and when they reached the escalator, the father and mother were wondering how the elderly lady would manage that.   
The granddaughter took her grandma near the escalator and asked her to play the Crane game.  Grandma raised her right foot and kept it one of the moving steps and raised her left leg by three inches and could easily reach the next moving step. 
This way she used the escalator easily to reach the higher level, much to the amazement of her son and daughter-in-law.  Then grandma and her grand daughter moved up and down several times on the escalator and had fun.  

They then went to the theatre to see a movie.  
As it was cold inside, granddaughter took out a shawl from her bag and covered the old lady, with a smile.  
She came prepared for this!  

After the movie, they went to the restaurant.  When the son asked his mother for the dish to be ordered, his daughter took away the menu and thrust it in the hands of Grandma.     

"You know how to read; go through the menu and order whatever you want".  Grandma decided about the dishes to be eaten. 

After the meal, Grandma and the grand daughter played some video games.  Before leaving for home, Grandma went to the toilet.  Using that occasion, the father asked his daughter how she knew so much about his mother which as a son, he was not aware. 

"Dad...., when a young child is taken out of the home, how many  preparations are made - milk bottles, diapers, wipes etc.!?....  Your  mother must have also done all these things for you.  Why not  show the same consideration for your mother? Why did you presume that she would be interested only in temples?   They also have normal desires,  enjoying with family, go out, have fun!  Since they may not openly express it, we have to compel them to enjoy these things" 

The father was speechless.  However he was happy that he had learnt a lesson from his ten year old daughter... 

*Reflection* 

A lot goes into making you who you are. We *assume* a lot of things about elderly parents which are not really true. 

It is called *generation gap* 
But it is a matter of *perspective* and *empathy* . 

Life is about giving back.
Do it graciously! 👍🙏

1/19/22, 10:19 PM - +91 98840 14141: *Beautiful message for our group ....*

A man, who regularly attended family & group meetings suddenly, without any notice, stopped participating. 

After a few weeks, one very cold night the Leader of that group decided to visit him.

He found the man at home, alone, sitting in front of a fireplace where a bright fire burned.

The man welcomed the leader. There was great calm & silence.

The two men only watched the dancing flames around the logs that crackled in the fireplace.

After a few minutes the leader, without saying a word, examined the logs that formed the fire and selected one of them, glowing most brightly of all, and removed it to the side with a pair of tongs.

Then he sat down again.

The host was paying attention to everything, fascinated. 
Before long, the lone log’s flame subsided, 
until there was only a momentary glow and the fire soon went out.

In a short time what was previously bright light and heat had become nothing more than a black dead piece of wood.

Very few words had been spoken since the greeting.

Before preparing to leave, the leader picked up the useless piece of wood with the tongs and placed it again in the middle of the fire. 
Immediately, the piece of wood was rekindled, fuelled by the light and heat of the burning logs around it.

When the leader was about to leave & had reached the door, the host said: ‘Thank you for your visit and for your beautiful lesson. 

I'll return to the group soon.’

Why is a group important in our lives ?

Very simple: Because each member that withdraws takes fire and heat from the rest.

*It's worth reminding group members that, they are a part of the flame.*

*It's also good to remind us that we are all responsible for keeping each other's flame burning.*

*And we must promote the union among us so that the fire is really strong, effective and lasting.*

*Keep the fire burning.*

*THE* *GROUP* *IS* *ALSO* *A* *FAMILY*
*It doesn't matter if sometimes we are bothered by so many messages, quarrels and misunderstandings*. 
What matters is to be connected. 

*We are here to meet, message, learn, exchange ideas or simply to know that we are not alone*

*Let's keep the flame alive in 2022 and beyond!*

1/26/22, 2:32 PM - +91 98451 59083: Even after having spent close to two thirds of  my lifetime, I didn’t know on #26thJanuary the national flag is 
#UNFURLED, while on #15thAugust it is #HOISTED till a close friend yesterday enlightened me about this basic fact !

The logic behind this is that on 15th August the flag is tied to the bottom of the pole, it is lifted up to the top and then hoisted.
To symbolise the #struggle for independence while lifting it up the pole and then celebrating independence by hoisting it.

While on 26th January India became an independent republic!
On the top now , free from the clutches of years of foreign occupation !
Thus the flag is tied to the top of the pole and not at the bottom as on 15th August.
Hence the Flag is UNFURLED!

(Hoist meaning to pull something up with a rope)

I am not sure how many of you know this, I didn’t know this for sure(I was hoisting the flag even on 26th January till now 😀)

Happy #RepublicDay and #FlagUnfurling in advance

"The Sun and the Cave"

"One day the Sun and a Cave struck up a conversation. The Sun had trouble understanding what “dark” meant and the Cave didn’t quite get the hang of “light and clear” so they decided to change places. 

The Cave went up to the Sun and said, “Ah, I see, this is beyond wonderful. Now come down and see where I have been living.” 
The Sun went down to the cave and said, “Gee, I don’t see any difference.”

When the sun went down, it took its light along and even the darkest corners were illuminated. That's why the Sun couldn't see any difference. 

There is a quote from an old book that says "The enlightened ones can never be sent to hell or pushed into darkness. They carry their heaven on their shoulders all the time".

We thought that heaven is a place where we are supposed to go, perhaps it was a state of mind we were supposed to achieve. 

If you are full of darkness within, full of negativity, fear, and doubt, you become a Cave unknowingly. It's hell within and no matter how much you accumulate, you still remain hollow. 

If you are illuminated like the Sun, then the darkness of the cave wouldn't matter. You could be in the worse of circumstances, you'll still be able to find a blessing somewhere.

You'll be carrying your Heaven with you."

3/31/22, 8:52 AM - +91 98451 59083: *For the information of all who drive long distances*

A fortnight back we, some friends in Ernakulam and nearby areas went on a trip to Munnar. 

We had the privilege to have an exceptionally brilliant driver with unmatched skills.  Since I too enjoy long distance drive I enquired about the skills he has developed.

He is working with a large transport company. He carries consignment across the country and abroad, to places like Bangladesh, Pakistan, Afganistan etc by road. Whenever bus/truck companies release new models, they give training to drivers of the buyer company. And his company invariably sends him for training. Thus he had opportunities to undergo training at Volvo, Sania, Bharat Benz and a few international brands. 

He told me the following information he got from one such training. I am sharing it as I feel it is vital. 


_We have heard of many fatal accidents occurring since the driver dozed while behind the wheels_. 

The trainer told in the class that it is not so in most of those mishaps. Reasearch has revealed that most of such drivers were not sleeping. Nowadays the cars are generally air-conditioned. When we drive wih A/C on especially when the car is full, carbon dioxide fills the cabin say in 3 to 4 hours and oxygen is depleted. The driver doesn't get enough oxygen and his brain becomes dull. He suffers a sort of fatigue which adversely affects his reflexes. He obviously loses control, fails to apply breaks or do what is necessary and collides. Many times we mistake it as sleep syndrome. 

Solution: 

Ideally, we *must* halt the vehicle every three or maximum four hours, open all doors and stay in open air at least for 2 or 3 minutes and continue our drive. This would be a very defensive step in driving. 

Happy driving to all my friends and family.

*1. Secure your life :-* 
You are not Laxman, and there is no Hanuman to get Sanjeevani for you.... so get health & life insurance today.

*2. Set your budget :-* 
Set "Laxman Rekha" of your financial budget and make sure not to  cross it due to luring online discounts. Understand the difference between need and want ....  be financially disciplined.

*3. Contingency Fund :-*
Unexpectedly, Lord Ram was sent to 'Vanvas' for 14 Years and was forced to leave his luxurious Palace. Not everyone can live with such sudden changes in lifestyle. Have an adequate emergency fund to handle unforeseen circumstances.

*4. Be Patient/Think Long Term :-*
During the 14 years of 'Vanvas', Lord Ram faced many ups and downs, including the kidnapping of Sita. Lord Ram patiently waited until the situation favorable, rather than choosing shortcuts. Stay invested for the long term, there is no shortcut to success.

*5. Choose advisers wisely :-* 
Kaikeyi took Manthara's advice... &  Ramayan happened. 
Stay away from those trying to sell Lucrative policies and distributors who are disguised as advisors for their own benefit.

*6. Build a Corpus :-*
Lord Ram, Sita, and Laxman left Ayodhya with nothing. They patiently built their  network and Vanar Sena over the years in order to reach the objective of defeating the Ravan. It takes patience to build a corpus, to defeat  inflation in the long run.

*7. Cultivate discipline :-*
Lord Ram practiced "Dharma" in order to be right, responsible and disciplined in life. Apply a similar theory to your life. Save judiciously, spend carefully and invest wisely for a disciplined financial life.

*8. Wipe your slate and start over :-*
14-day Lanka War marked the defeat of evil and set the stage for a new path. Similarly, forget bad decisions that you made in the past and make informed decisions to streamline your financial journey.

*Believe in karma :-* Continue to do good things and karma will eventually reach you.

 *Happy Ram Navami*
