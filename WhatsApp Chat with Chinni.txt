9/7/21, 03:09 - Chinni: Oh okay
9/7/21, 03:09 - Chinni: But u know when i was a kid i used to watch the starting parts and used feel like

9/7/21, 03:11 - Apoorv: Yeah. But it's not too disappointing. I mean Ginny was fine with Harry, and if Harry gets married to hermoine then Ron would be left alone

9/8/21, 02:02 - Apoorv: When he moved , I was in 6th std and my sister was in 8th. So for a year we lived in hostel in Varanasi
9/8/21, 02:02 - Apoorv: The life over there was pathetic
9/8/21, 02:02 - Chinni: Haha yeah i know this😅
9/8/21, 02:03 - Chinni: Aiyooo
9/8/21, 02:03 - Apoorv: I was a guy who use to live with my mom dad 24*7 and suddenly they left I was super angry with them and use to cry whole day in hostel
9/8/21, 02:03 - Apoorv: Most of the kid used to laugh on me and I had no friend for a year
9/8/21, 02:04 - Apoorv: But that is the phase which taught me a lot. 🤪
9/8/21, 02:04 - Chinni: Owww🥺
9/8/21, 02:04 - Chinni: Haha nice
9/8/21, 02:04 - Apoorv: After that, my while personality changed. Like  I became a person who doesn't care whether someone is there or not. I love being with myself and I don't look for happiness in others.
9/8/21, 02:05 - Chinni: Aww... Same me too
9/8/21, 02:05 - Apoorv: After that I came to Pune in 7th. And over here, I joined city international school
9/8/21, 02:05 - Chinni: Oh nice!
9/8/21, 02:05 - Apoorv: This school was amazing. I made so many close friends with whom I talk even now.
9/8/21, 02:06 - Apoorv: In school, I was discipline in-charge of whole school
9/8/21, 02:06 - Chinni: Oh thats really great😁
9/8/21, 02:07 - Apoorv: Also, I joined dance class when I came to Pune and in 8th std, I got the chance to come on tv. We participated in chak Dhoom Dhoom (tv show like dance India dance) and we have to leave it in middle due to some issues
9/8/21, 02:07 - Apoorv: So in whole school I was kinda popular
9/8/21, 02:07 - Chinni: Oh my God...  that's really awesome
9/8/21, 02:08 - Chinni: Haha nice
9/8/21, 02:08 - Apoorv: Now I was from a place where no one use to talk to me and now everyone wanted to talk, so that was kinda weird to me. 😅
9/8/21, 02:08 - Chinni: Hahaha
9/8/21, 02:08 - Apoorv: Then in 9th std, papa asked me to leave dancing and focus on my studies as it use to take lot of time
9/8/21, 02:09 - Apoorv: So I left my dance class and started focusing on studies.
9/8/21, 02:09 - Apoorv: I was not studios or brilliant at that time.
9/8/21, 02:09 - Chinni: Oh okay
9/8/21, 02:09 - Apoorv: Then I gave my 9-10 and went to Camp education society for my 11-12
9/8/21, 02:10 - Apoorv: That clg was not that great, it was govt clg
9/8/21, 02:10 - Apoorv: And I was from private school
9/8/21, 02:10 - Apoorv: So culture and environment was different
9/8/21, 02:10 - Apoorv: It was difficult for me to adjust. But I don't have any other option
9/8/21, 02:11 - Apoorv: I had left my dancing and since 11th , I started studying
9/8/21, 02:11 - Chinni: Okay nice!!
9/8/21, 02:11 - Apoorv: So I scored good in my 11th but in 12th, a tragedy happened bcz of which my 12th boards got affected and I scored 69%😅
9/8/21, 02:11 - Chinni: Whats that tragedy?
9/8/21, 02:12 - Apoorv: My father was diagnosed with Kidney disease and doc told that he won't live for long
9/8/21, 02:12 - Chinni: Oh that's so sad
9/8/21, 02:12 - Chinni: But there's no cure for it?
9/8/21, 02:12 - Apoorv: As I said he was my best friend. So it was difficult for me to digest. My sister was in clg that time so I told my mother to not tell her. Only we kept it in us
9/8/21, 02:13 - Apoorv: So we didn't tell papa too about this and soon his health became fine. He started working again and everything worked out well
9/8/21, 02:13 - Chinni: Ohh, and yeah i can understand how it feels like to know about it
9/8/21, 02:13 - Apoorv: My father was in a senior position, so he use to take multiple interviews
9/8/21, 02:13 - Chinni: Oh nice
9/8/21, 02:14 - Apoorv: So he never wanted me to do engineering
9/8/21, 02:14 - Apoorv: So I did bsc statistics
9/8/21, 02:14 - Apoorv: I took admission in SP college. One of the top college in Pune for stats
9/8/21, 02:14 - Chinni: Oh okay
9/8/21, 02:14 - Chinni: Oh great!!
9/8/21, 02:15 - Apoorv: I met so many amazing people over there. I was part of NSS. So did so many social services and I topped most of the exams in stats
9/8/21, 02:15 - Apoorv: I was the most scholar one there
9/8/21, 02:15 - Chinni: So great😍👌🏻
9/8/21, 02:15 - Apoorv: We had maths, chem and physics too in clg, but I never score that great in them
9/8/21, 02:16 - Chinni: So is it cured for your father?
9/8/21, 02:16 - Apoorv: And every teacher , hod and even our principal used to know me
9/8/21, 02:16 - Apoorv: I'm coming to this part
9/8/21, 02:16 - Chinni: Haha nice
9/8/21, 02:16 - Chinni: Ok
9/8/21, 02:16 - Apoorv: So I joined clg in 2015, and later we met one homeopathy doctor who started treating father. His kidney started getting better
9/8/21, 02:17 - Apoorv: But on 14th feb 2017 , dad met with an accident
9/8/21, 02:17 - Chinni: Oh my god
9/8/21, 02:17 - Chinni: so is he fine ?
9/8/21, 02:17 - Apoorv: He had 5 fractures, and because of that accident, his bp rose and it affected his entire kidney
9/8/21, 02:17 - Apoorv: Dialysis started
9/8/21, 02:18 - Chinni: Oh nooooo
9/8/21, 02:18 - Apoorv: And he use to have dialysis twice a week
9/8/21, 02:18 - Apoorv: Now the phase after that was really difficult. I couldn't see papa in such pain
9/8/21, 02:18 - Apoorv: I use to be with them almost everytime
9/8/21, 02:18 - Apoorv: I use to skip clg and go only for practicals
9/8/21, 02:19 - Apoorv: To make sure papa is not staying alone
9/8/21, 02:19 - Apoorv: But I already scored low in 12th so I made sure that I won't let it affect this year
9/8/21, 02:20 - Apoorv: In 2017, I started my 3 and final year of my clg and I scored really well
9/8/21, 02:20 - Apoorv: After that, I wanted to go out for further studies but I can't ask my parents because there were too many expenses on dad's health so I thought if taking a year gap and prepare for govt exams
9/8/21, 02:21 - Chinni: Okay
9/8/21, 02:21 - Apoorv: I prepared for my enterance but could not clear them so my father asked me to join the job as I was getting depressed day by day
9/8/21, 02:22 - Apoorv: My sister used to work in Amazon so she asked whether the opening is there or not. It was there and I joined Amazon in 2019
9/8/21, 02:22 - Chinni: Oh nice
9/8/21, 02:22 - Chinni: Is she still working in amazon?
9/8/21, 02:22 - Apoorv: The day I got selected for  Amazon, I was so shocked as I couldn't believe that I am even capable of getting selected anywhere
9/8/21, 02:22 - Chinni: Haha
9/8/21, 02:22 - Apoorv: I was that much depressed that time
9/8/21, 02:23 - Apoorv: I could not believe only
9/8/21, 02:23 - Apoorv: But then later I joined Amazon, and I felt better
9/8/21, 02:23 - Chinni: Nice
9/8/21, 02:23 - Apoorv: Now I missed one thing.
9/8/21, 02:23 - Chinni: What?
9/8/21, 02:23 - Apoorv: So due to that depression, it started affecting my health.
9/8/21, 02:23 - Apoorv: So after joining Amazon, even my health got better
9/8/21, 02:24 - Apoorv: Then comes the lockdown
9/8/21, 02:24 - Apoorv: One of the best thing that can happen tbh.
9/8/21, 02:24 - Chinni: Good..
9/8/21, 02:24 - Apoorv: I use to get lots and lots of time to spend with my father
9/8/21, 02:24 - Apoorv: I use to sit and talk with him everyday for hours
9/8/21, 02:24 - Chinni: Yeah☺️
9/8/21, 02:24 - Apoorv: Even my mom too.
9/8/21, 02:25 - Chinni: Nice
9/8/21, 02:25 - Apoorv: Me and papa use to tease mom a lot
9/8/21, 02:25 - Chinni: 😅😅
9/8/21, 02:25 - Apoorv: Then I got moved to Case role, when I told papa that I got promoted. He cried , I saw tears in his eyes and that was the most memorable thing I have
9/8/21, 02:25 - Chinni: Awww
9/8/21, 02:27 - Apoorv: Now , before I became permanent in Case, on 10th April 2021, papa passed away suddenly due to heart stroke
9/8/21, 02:27 - Chinni: Oh noo.. I am so sorry for your loss
9/8/21, 02:27 - Apoorv: I was not prepared for that. It all happened so suddenly that I couldn't do anything.
9/8/21, 02:28 - Chinni: Idk how to react
9/8/21, 02:28 - Apoorv: And in 1st week of May, when I got permanent na, I literally cried. I cried alot. I always wanted to take him to a trip once I became permanent
9/8/21, 02:28 - Chinni: Really sorry for asking u to explain and making u feel sad about it
9/8/21, 02:28 - Apoorv: But I didn't
9/8/21, 02:29 - Chinni: I am sure, he will definitely be happy for all your successes and will be blessing u always
9/8/21, 02:29 - Apoorv: So before becoming permanent, I already applied for this ijp so when I was selected, I moved because I needed a change

9/13/21, 01:04 - Chinni: i like that i made many new frnds and the process is interesting
9/13/21, 01:04 - Chinni: but i should have joined in HR or something else

9/13/21, 01:05 - Chinni: Coz now my previous exp is not consideree if i wanna move within amazon to a diff role
9/13/21, 01:05 - Chinni: I still feel am struck here
9/13/21, 01:05 - Chinni: Now QA is good
9/13/21, 01:05 - Chinni: I just wanna be here but somewhere i feel i am still CS
9/13/21, 01:06 - Chinni: And now if i move to HR na.. I will considered for small roles only coz i didnt had that particular exp
9/13/21, 01:06 - Chinni: So its like no future onky

9/13/21, 01:07 - Chinni: and ofc we are gonna be in QA only
9/13/21, 01:08 - Chinni: but a person i know who got permanent in QA told me
9/13/21, 01:08 - Chinni: That in their batch only 1 person was not made permanent
9/13/21, 01:08 - Chinni: because he said he gonna move t a diff process/somewhere
9/13/21, 01:09 - Chinni: So he wasnt permanent
9/13/21, 01:09 - Chinni: Hahaha

9/13/21, 01:09 - Apoorv: Yeah. Don't worry. It will be between us only
9/13/21, 01:10 - Chinni: So bymistake if u say this to some one tenured or TM na

9/13/21, 01:11 - Chinni: Yeah see its a point na.. Why will they make him permanent if they already knew that hes gonna leave the role?
9/13/21, 01:11 - Chinni: Haha yeah yeah i understand

9/16/21, 03:05 - Chinni: Then?
9/16/21, 03:06 - Apoorv: Does it ever happened with you that when we audit DNR one day, the other day we are clueless what parameters to check and sometimes after 3-4 audits we realise that we missed on checking one parameter on previous contacts?
9/16/21, 03:07 - Chinni: Haha not really happend
9/16/21, 03:07 - Apoorv: Okay then, my bad🙈
9/16/21, 03:07 - Chinni: But I feel like did I missed this parameter that day when I audited?😅
9/16/21, 03:07 - Chinni: For u?
9/16/21, 03:07 - Apoorv: Yeah. Almost always
9/16/21, 03:07 - Chinni: Okay understood, so we gonna make flow charts about policies?
9/16/21, 03:08 - Apoorv: Not policies. But what we gonna check
9/16/21, 03:08 - Chinni: Even I had this thing in mind but thought of doing it once we are assigned to a particular audit program
9/16/21, 03:08 - Apoorv: Like sent to customer for mdr ,
9/16/21, 03:08 - Chinni: Aiyo
9/16/21, 03:08 - Apoorv: For DNR, otp is mandatory
9/16/21, 03:08 - Apoorv: 🙈
9/16/21, 03:08 - Chinni: Oh yeah true, the things that are not there in policies
9/16/21, 03:09 - Apoorv: Exactly
9/16/21, 03:09 - Apoorv: That's what
9/16/21, 03:09 - Chinni: Like for DNR
Check CAR filled or not
Rspr followed
Email sent
9/16/21, 03:09 - Chinni: Like that?
9/16/21, 03:09 - Apoorv: Yeah, yeah
9/16/21, 03:09 - Chinni: For mdr, check buyer returns in cim
9/16/21, 03:09 - Chinni: Yeah yeah
9/16/21, 03:09 - Apoorv: Would you wanna do with me?
9/16/21, 03:09 - Chinni: Not lying.. but seriously I too had this in mind but every time I think to make it I get distracted
9/16/21, 03:10 - Apoorv: Nice
9/16/21, 03:10 - Chinni: Seriously not just copying what u said.. I really had those thougjts in mind
9/16/21, 03:10 - Chinni: See we think similarly😅😍
9/16/21, 03:10 - Apoorv: Yeah, It's fine
9/16/21, 03:10 - Chinni: Yeah ofcourse
9/16/21, 03:10 - Apoorv: Its very simple thing
9/16/21, 03:11 - Apoorv: Yeah☺️
9/16/21, 03:11 - Apoorv: Cool then, we won't get distracted too if we do it together
9/16/21, 03:11 - Chinni: We can also make flow charts of polices once we become permanent or atleast assigned to audits
9/16/21, 03:11 - Chinni: Coz u know
9/16/21, 03:11 - Chinni: Everytime I audit na.. I will open all the policies and then it is sometimes confusing and searching like that
9/16/21, 03:12 - Apoorv: Yeah, true. We can do that
9/16/21, 03:12 - Chinni: That day esli did na.. so like that if we make flowcharts for everything it would be very easy for us to just look into
9/16/21, 03:12 - Apoorv: Yeah, true
9/16/21, 03:12 - Chinni: Yeah true
9/16/21, 03:12 - Apoorv: ☺️☺️☺️

9/18/21, 23:46 - Chinni: But I don't blame the current leaders too..
They are doing good..
Maybe not great.. but since it's tough and I don't know there position.. I won't comment on current leaders.. if I don't like there leadership.. I will vote someone new..  that's all we can do, right ?
9/18/21, 23:47 - Chinni: I feel it's not right to blame simply without knowing what they are going through in that position since we never handled the country/  state
9/18/21, 23:47 - Apoorv: Yeah, that's what democracy is all about, if you don't like their work, you can vote for someone else

9/18/21, 23:48 - Apoorv: See, I completely agree views of people can mismatch, they can definitely vote against them in elections na, why to spread negativity on social media
9/18/21, 23:49 - Apoorv: I do not support any party, but I like the work of Narendra Modi ji and Amit Shah Ji, also I idolize Ravi Shankar Prasad ji too
9/18/21, 23:49 - Chinni: Yeah exactly.. it's the people who voted and made them leaders... If you don't like their work.. just have realisation and give a chance to someone new whom you might feel like they will do well ..
9/18/21, 23:50 - Apoorv: Exactly.
9/18/21, 23:50 - Apoorv: But I like politics so much , I always keep updated with it😅
9/18/21, 23:50 - Apoorv: In which state, what is going in

9/22/21, 01:46 - Chinni: Haha okay
9/22/21, 01:48 - Apoorv: So I hesitated while messaging you, I thought you might not like socializing as you never talk on chime meeting or anyplace. So I was afraid that what will you think, so when I texted you, I created group and asked everyone else to make sure you don't feel awkward 😅
9/22/21, 01:49 - Chinni: Hahaha
9/22/21, 01:49 - Chinni: Nice

9/22/21, 01:56 - Chinni: Also you know I have this kind of thing in my mind. I don't have anything about work to ask.. if I text u simply hi like that

9/25/21, 23:40 - Chinni: Idk 😅😂
9/25/21, 23:40 - Apoorv: Okay
9/25/21, 23:40 - Apoorv: Kuch to hoga
9/25/21, 23:41 - Chinni: Maybe normal candle light dinner somewhere near to beaches
9/25/21, 23:41 - Apoorv: Ok
9/25/21, 23:42 - Chinni: You say?
9/25/21, 23:42 - Apoorv: Okay ,
9/25/21, 23:43 - Apoorv: So I don't like people, so it'd be on a place where no one else will be, like camping. With bonfire and making maggi in the midnight and eating it while gazing at stars and talking
9/25/21, 23:43 - Chinni: Ahaha
9/25/21, 23:44 - Apoorv: Something like this
9/25/21, 23:44 - Chinni: That's so nice

9/25/21, 23:44 - Apoorv: I know stupid hai😅
9/25/21, 23:45 - Apoorv: But it's what I prefer, rather than buying food from out, perfect date would be making with that person. And just go to a place where you both can talk your heart out
9/25/21, 23:45 - Chinni: Yeah, that's true and it's nice actually
9/25/21, 23:45 - Apoorv: Hmm

10/1/21, 00:30 - Chinni: But you are different na
10/1/21, 00:31 - Apoorv: But Idk why, I have this nature of taking everyone and move forward. You know, I could easily start assigning DNR audits and leave everyone on their own. But I thought to include everyone and I ask permission from all the previous QA who use to assign audits that can we assign audits and once they said yes, I msgs Esli too
10/1/21, 00:31 - Chinni: So they think u only work all the time during shift
10/1/21, 00:32 - Chinni: So that is why they don't disturb u
10/1/21, 00:32 - Chinni: Sorry I lost power
10/1/21, 00:32 - Apoorv: But I am not like that na😅
10/1/21, 00:32 - Chinni: Soo
10/1/21, 00:32 - Chinni: Late replies
10/1/21, 00:32 - Apoorv: Ok
10/1/21, 00:33 - Chinni: Yeah, I really appreciate it and it's so nice of u for taking that initiative
10/1/21, 00:33 - Chinni: I really liked it
10/1/21, 00:33 - Chinni: But you know we 3 are afraid of DNR since we have to assign it on the same day😅
10/1/21, 00:33 - Chinni: So no one wanna take it
10/1/21, 00:33 - Chinni: But I told u na I can be your backup if u want.. coz I know it's hard for u to assign all the time..
10/1/21, 00:34 - Chinni: Yeah you are not like that . But they don't know na..
10/1/21, 00:34 - Chinni: I told them once or twice
10/1/21, 00:34 - Apoorv: You did?
10/1/21, 00:34 - Apoorv: Yeah. I got the feeling 😅
10/1/21, 00:34 - Apoorv: That's why I took it na
10/1/21, 00:34 - Chinni: Yeah.. when some topic came like apoorv and ruturaj might have done and working on it something like that
10/1/21, 00:34 - Chinni: So I said I talk with apoorv na, he is not that workaholic he is fun and good
10/1/21, 00:35 - Chinni: They know that I talk with u
10/1/21, 00:35 - Chinni: Haha yeah
10/1/21, 00:35 - Apoorv: Okay. That's nice
10/1/21, 00:35 - Apoorv: Hmm.
10/1/21, 00:36 - Apoorv: You know, now I have to ask Himabindu to be my backup in DNR. I wanted you🙈
10/1/21, 00:36 - Apoorv: I mean once she is onboard with it
10/1/21, 00:37 - Chinni: Haha yeah I know
10/1/21, 00:37 - Chinni: Even I wanna say my name
10/1/21, 00:37 - Apoorv: Why you didn't??
10/1/21, 00:37 - Chinni: But sometimes I can't take lot of stress
10/1/21, 00:37 - Chinni: DD I did last night and even while uploading veena added us on call
10/1/21, 00:37 - Chinni: So I did both simultaneously and I messed up veenas audits

10/2/21, 01:11 - Apoorv: You think it will be spoil if yo love someone?
10/2/21, 01:11 - Chinni: Yeah
10/2/21, 01:12 - Apoorv: Can I say something,
10/2/21, 01:12 - Apoorv: I shouldn't as it's your personal matter
10/2/21, 01:12 - Chinni: Yeah
10/2/21, 01:12 - Apoorv: But still can I?
10/2/21, 01:12 - Chinni: Hahah
10/2/21, 01:12 - Chinni: Yes u can
10/2/21, 01:13 - Apoorv: So I don't think that if you love someone, your parents will look down on you. 

If you are going in dates, roaming here and there with a guy and running away with him will definitely spoil your image. 

But if you love someone and you tell your parents straight up without doing any nonsense, I don't think they will look down on you
10/2/21, 01:14 - Apoorv: You can tell your parents, then let them approve
10/2/21, 01:14 - Chinni: Yeah
10/2/21, 01:14 - Apoorv: Just never abandon your parents for any guy.
10/2/21, 01:14 - Chinni: But what if they dont approve?
10/2/21, 01:15 - Apoorv: That's what you have to make them understand na
10/2/21, 01:15 - Chinni: Haha yea
10/2/21, 01:15 - Apoorv: 😅

10/2/21, 01:21 - Apoorv: Even I wanna be in love. But I want something serious. Timepass nahi, like I don't wanna spend my time with someone who doesn't worth it

10/2/21, 01:25 - Apoorv: Prr is not calculated in Case. Ccxu is calculated
10/2/21, 01:25 - Chinni: I am not sure because of that or not but he got a warning email or first written warning or CAP something about aux abuse
10/2/21, 01:25 - Chinni: He still have time till Jan ending to become permanent
10/2/21, 01:25 - Chinni: Yeah something like that.. he is maintaining metrics only
10/2/21, 01:26 - Chinni: Will he get permanent?
10/2/21, 01:26 - Chinni: Or will this effects him?
10/2/21, 01:26 - Apoorv: This depends on Grpm and Ops now, if his other parameters are fine and there is a requirement, they may overlook that, otherwise they may not overlook it.
10/2/21, 01:26 - Chinni: Ohh
10/2/21, 01:27 - Apoorv: Bcz you know na if aux abuse is there
10/2/21, 01:27 - Apoorv: Scorecard also gets affected
10/2/21, 01:27 - Chinni: His manager told him that it won't be a considered something like that ... And asked him not to worry
10/2/21, 01:27 - Apoorv: As far as I remembered, There are 10 points for aux
10/2/21, 01:27 - Apoorv: Aux adherence
10/2/21, 01:28 - Chinni: But still I am worried actually.. he was so good to me.. and he helped me a lot when we're in previous skill.. he was actually my SME that time.. 

So we both came to L3 like 2 months difference.. but I am feeling sad for him.. for that cap
10/2/21, 01:28 - Chinni: Yeah
10/2/21, 01:28 - Chinni: Oh..

10/15/21, 00:37 - Apoorv: I have to do it on my own
10/15/21, 00:37 - Apoorv: I was going through Google and everything to learn how to make doc
10/15/21, 00:37 - Apoorv: I did that and this week, I was in call with hriiziia to cross check it

10/15/21, 00:40 - Chinni: So after observing 2 or 3 times
10/15/21, 00:40 - Chinni: I thought okay, he is doing by his own
10/15/21, 00:40 - Apoorv: Like what? Can you tell me

10/15/21, 00:41 - Chinni: I already told u..
10/15/21, 00:41 - Chinni: I thought I should also do on my own without informing anyone until they ask me
10/15/21, 00:41 - Apoorv: Okay, I am really sorry if I made you feel that way, but my intentions are never to do things alone.
10/15/21, 00:41 - Chinni: Since prabinsa asks me I told her
10/15/21, 00:41 - Apoorv: I want you to be with me
10/15/21, 00:42 - Chinni: Aiyoo noo.. am not angry or jealous about it.. I just thought I should also do by my own without waiting for others
10/15/21, 00:42 - Chinni: Actually I also experienced something today
10/15/21, 00:42 - Apoorv: But then, you are also not talking much nowadays na
10/15/21, 00:42 - Apoorv: What?
10/15/21, 00:42 - Chinni: Actually I got my profile changed last week.. but I waited for 1 person to get her profile changed so that we can start taking chats
10/15/21, 00:43 - Chinni: I didn't took any chat or email
10/15/21, 00:43 - Chinni: But that person took chats yesterday without informing me and acting like they didn't took any still
10/15/21, 00:43 - Chinni: I literally waited for a week
10/15/21, 00:43 - Apoorv: You can name the person, I won't tell anyone
10/15/21, 00:43 - Chinni: Oy.. don't say that.. it's you who is sleeping early😅😏😏

10/15/21, 00:47 - Apoorv: I wait for you and sleep automatically

10/15/21, 00:48 - Chinni: Ha
10/15/21, 00:49 - Apoorv: I don't want to hurt you in any way, I always tell you whatever new thing I am doing, just with the docs I am working for projects, once they are approved, I will tell you first, because if they are rejected, what is the point of telling
10/15/21, 00:49 - Chinni: Aiyooo
10/15/21, 00:49 - Apoorv: Islie I don't tell
10/15/21, 00:49 - Apoorv: Don't you think it's right
10/15/21, 00:50 - Chinni: Areyy yaar noo
10/15/21, 00:50 - Apoorv: I mean if I say I have submitted many ideas and all of them are rejected, would it be of any worth?
10/15/21, 00:50 - Chinni: I never felt that way actually
10/15/21, 00:50 - Apoorv: Or once they are selected, then I should say, that hey, my idea is selected
10/15/21, 00:50 - Chinni: I just told u just because u asked me
10/15/21, 00:50 - Chinni: I know what ever reasons I told u  all of them are not valid
10/15/21, 00:51 - Chinni: True
10/15/21, 00:51 - Apoorv: You were hurt by Prabinsa and you release that anger in me
10/15/21, 00:51 - Chinni: Yeah not angry but felt bad

10/16/21, 01:03 - Apoorv: Pakka?
10/16/21, 01:03 - Chinni: U were about to ask something
10/16/21, 01:03 - Chinni: Yesss
10/16/21, 01:03 - Apoorv: Why did you convert from hindu?
10/16/21, 01:04 - Chinni: Actually not me
10/16/21, 01:04 - Chinni: My father got converted first
10/16/21, 01:04 - Apoorv: Yeah, I mean your family
10/16/21, 01:04 - Chinni: He actually did his studies in missionary schools
10/16/21, 01:04 - Chinni: And at the same time during his graduation he worked in Christian missionaries
10/16/21, 01:05 - Chinni: Under priests
10/16/21, 01:05 - Apoorv: Okay
10/16/21, 01:05 - Chinni: So he spent most of his childhood and teen days in and around priests only
10/16/21, 01:05 - Apoorv: Okay,
10/16/21, 01:05 - Chinni: And visited churches and gradually he got faith in Jesus Christ
10/16/21, 01:06 - Chinni: And my dad's parents fixed match with my mom
10/16/21, 01:06 - Chinni: And after marriage after few months
10/16/21, 01:06 - Chinni: My mom also got converted
10/16/21, 01:06 - Chinni: After marriage
10/16/21, 01:06 - Apoorv: Okay
10/16/21, 01:06 - Chinni: And we (me and my siblings ) haven't converted completely.. but we believe in Jesus Christ only
10/16/21, 01:07 - Apoorv: If your parents are Christian before your birth, you will be Christian only na
10/16/21, 01:07 - Chinni: The reason we haven't converted is because.. in our community we won't have people got converted ... So if we get converted we should only marry in Christian style
10/16/21, 01:07 - Chinni: So due to those issues, we didn't took communion yet
10/16/21, 01:07 - Chinni: Nooo
10/16/21, 01:08 - Apoorv: I didn't understand actually😅
10/16/21, 01:08 - Chinni: We have to take communion in church to get converted
10/16/21, 01:08 - Apoorv: Oh, I didn't know that
10/16/21, 01:08 - Chinni: Yeah... If we believe Christ we can go to church and prayer for him.
10/16/21, 01:08 - Apoorv: Okay
10/16/21, 01:09 - Chinni: But we will be considered completely into Christ once we take communion (it is made with wheat and it will dipped into wine considering it as Jesus Christ's body and blood)
10/16/21, 01:09 - Apoorv: Okay
10/16/21, 01:10 - Chinni: So we didn't took it.. only my mom and dad took
10/16/21, 01:10 - Chinni: My dad took before his marriage
10/16/21, 01:10 - Chinni: My mom took during marriage
10/16/21, 01:10 - Apoorv: Okay okay, I was just curious to know, there was nothing else
10/16/21, 01:10 - Apoorv: Don't feeo offended I ask
10/16/21, 01:11 - Apoorv: 😅
10/16/21, 01:11 - Chinni: Actually.. community in the sense caste.. so there will be very few poeple in our caste who believe in Christ.. 
If I get converted to Christianity.. I shouldn't marry in hindu style

So if in case in future ifwe can't find any Christian in our community we should nary hindu people only.. so that is why we didn't took communion
10/16/21, 01:12 - Apoorv: Ok. Got it😅
10/16/21, 01:12 - Chinni: Haha it's okay
10/16/21, 01:12 - Chinni: Haha no way
10/16/21, 01:12 - Chinni: Why would I feel like that
10/16/21, 01:12 - Apoorv: ☺️
10/16/21, 01:12 - Chinni: Many people asked me
10/16/21, 01:12 - Chinni: My frnds
10/16/21, 01:12 - Apoorv: No, I was actually afraid to ask😅
10/16/21, 01:12 - Chinni: Haha
10/16/21, 01:12 - Chinni: It's okay
10/16/21, 01:12 - Apoorv: I mean, it doesn't matter what religion you follow or whom you pray
10/16/21, 01:13 - Chinni: Yeah
10/16/21, 01:13 - Apoorv: If you are a nice person, that's matter
10/16/21, 01:13 - Apoorv: But I actually never met someone yet who converted from one religion to another
10/16/21, 01:13 - Apoorv: So I wanted to know
10/16/21, 01:13 - Chinni: Hahaa
10/16/21, 01:13 - Chinni: Okay
10/16/21, 01:13 - Apoorv: Like your grandmother was kind of a priest you use to do so many pooja na
10/16/21, 01:14 - Apoorv: So why your family follow Christianity
10/16/21, 01:14 - Chinni: Maybe not many in your place.. but here there will be many people who get converted especially to Christianity.. here means south side
10/16/21, 01:14 - Apoorv: Yeah, I have heard and read a lot about it. But I never met someone na

1/7/22, 00:20 - Apoorv: Happpppyyyyy birthday Chinniiiiiiiiii. (I tried asking your address several times because I want to send you a gift, but you never gave so here is a written note from me to you on your birthday. ) I still remember the first time I talk with you over chime, it was related to super audits and I was skeptical before sending you a msg as I never know how would you react, or whether you'll feel good or not however still I took the risk and send the msg and tbh, that decision became one of the best decision of my life as I get to know an amazing person and get this close to her. I feel blessed that you are an important part of my life. Whenever I need to talk, I know you are there to hear me out. No matter what happens , I know you'll be there. I still remember all the conversation we had, all the talks , all the secrets we have shared( Like yours super secret😛) , all the games we use to play and skip our sleep. It was all fun and I miss each and every part of it. Just I got a little busy so I couldn't message you that much, but you are one of the most important person of my life and you will be. There's lot I wanna learn from you and there's lot I wanna make you learn. We both started excel together and even now SharePoint. I can see that I am learning at a great pace with you, bcz of you. And I am proud of that. 

In the world we live in, it is really difficult to find a beautiful, charming and a kindhearted person like you (who looks like Pranitha Subhash). I am really glad I move to QA and met you, you the most amazing person I have ever met and you will always be the person who is closest to me. In the end. Happy birthday again Chinniiiiiiiiii
